100,429,TRUE,5/6/2019 12:08,"I would like to see some visual material that helps make clear the relationships different elements will have in various layers of Islandora, the relationships between records (such as if the creator of one record is the subject of another), and the metadata mapping process from beginning to end.",All of the above are important. I would find training on the migration tools very helpful because then I could test the mapping decisions easier and I might be able to provide more feedback.,"My primary concern is that I've been working and contributing and I still find the mapping and the migration very confusing. It makes me worry that this won't be accessible, or that we could be making bad decisions that will be hard to walk back. I'm also worried about the metadata we're not mapping. We've mapped the descriptive metadata from MODS, but what about all of the administrative and technical metadata? How is it being mapped? It seems to be in the hands of programmers rather than being consulted on by metadata librarians and I'm concerned about what is happening in that black box."
100,523,TRUE,5/13/2019 11:39,I think creating a document containing examples is extremely helpful. ,"I think a migration tool to help analyze and clean-up MODS would be  fantastic idea, along with training on the migration tools for Islandora 8. ","I don't think I have concerns. I'm still pretty new to metadata and Islandora (and still trying to wrap my head around things). 

Thank you!!"
100,988,TRUE,5/14/2019 7:11,I would really love to see some documents on how to prepare for metadata migration or examples of what has been done in the past. ,"To be honest, all three of those examples would be great things to work on. A Metadata Application profile would be something I'd be very interested in working on.",My concerns are that we will find good ways to work on mapping and migration and Islandora itself will become a bit more of a mess and we'll be constantly having to find fixes.

#### Agenda Items:
* Welcome and introductions
* Brief summary of new format for MIG: The Metadata IG now integrates discussions as well as round tables. Each month a volunteer leads a discussion on a topic of interest. The goal is to learn new ideas and network. The round table is another opportunity for attendees to ask questions, share information, and learn about new approaches. This new format will also include reports from the subgroups. Members are encouraged to participate in the subgroups which can be found on our wiki.
* The discussion will be led by Jennifer Eustis on tools for metadata migration and review 
** Next month which will be led by Martha Tenney on customizing the manuscript solution pack.

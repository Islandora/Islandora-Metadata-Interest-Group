	What time?
12:15:38 From Paige Morfitt to Everyone:
	So if you delete fields in Easy Mode, it will not delete in the Default form?

12:32:18 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:

12:36:33 From Rosie Le Faive (they/she) to Everyone:
	Amazing spreadsheet
12:40:44 From Paige Morfitt to Everyone:
	Looking at this, it would be awesome to add in roles and mark which roles have access to which fields (if you have roles)
12:44:29 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:
	It might be good to split out display configurations to another sheet, since this spreadsheet is pretty broad?
12:49:10 From Paige Morfitt to Everyone:
	That could be it's own tab, one that explains the meaning of each column. But I agree, that would be a lot of work.

	Thanks, all!
12:56:05 From Pascal Brammeier - Marmot (he/him/his) to Everyone:

### Notes:

OPEN MEETING: ADD A LINE OR TWO
DOCUMENTATION OF FIELDS: Starter Site Metadata Configuration
has link to spreadsheet
updated other pages to link to the new page
ROSIE WILL BE ATTENDING DRUPALCON, WILL REPORT BACK IF SHE LEARNS ANYTHING FUN
ROSIE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW WAYS TO SHARE NEW FUNCTIONALITY IN WAYS THAT IS NOT TOO DISRUPTIVE

No Updates To Starter Site: But will be adding "Field Representative Image" system field. Used for collections or compounds, any "parent" that may not have an assigned thumbnail, but which may have a child that has one. DGI Image Discovery module.

PARAGRAPHS
Now available for use within Islandora Workbench. Does not work with RDF out of the box. Not certain if lack of RDF support is a major issue for most use cases, if Drupal is source of truth and aren't exposing blazegraph or fedora

Do we want to start using paragraphs in Islandora Starter Site.
 Identifier field, with drop down
 Notes, but would have to have a separate field for "restricted access" notes
 Title, either programmatic way of transforming Title Field into Note Title, or use Title Paragraph for alternative titles.
 Origin Information, an interesting case if you are using Event Type for things like publication, manufacturing, distribution, etc.

 XML
 Conversation? Tools? What we love? What we hate?
 Trycia: deal with metadata now or after migration; using scripts for certain clean-ups while still in XML, so things conform to I8; types and authorities standardization; are very comfortable with XML, and know how to work with it, so deal with it now while it is still an option
 XSLT: what to take care of as a transform vs what to edit in the original XML
 Rosie: have xslt to convert to fields like workbench and then print report for fields/data that does not transform
 T: Use python for flattening
 Seth: XSLT not as good for making complex decisions, easier to do with programming (python, etc)

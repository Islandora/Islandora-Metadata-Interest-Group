### Notes:
ANNOUNCEMENTS
* Islandora Open Meeting, April 30, Noon ET
  * Chris will be talking about possible Institutional Repositiory metadata fields and taxonomies that have been discussed by the Institutional Repository Interest Group. He will also do a show-&-tell about the MIG's Starter Site Metadata Configuration spreadsheet/documentation work.
* Islandora Starter Site Metadata Configuration Documentation [https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/starter-site-metadata-configuration/](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/starter-site-metadata-configuration/)
  * Live on the documentation site. Other related Metadata pages updated to include links. Includes link to spreadsheet
* Rosie will be attending [DrupalCon](https://events.drupal.org/portland2024), Portland, OR, May 6-9. She will look for fun things to bring back and show-&-tell. Especially Drupal functionality that can be brought into the Islandora sphere without being too disruptive (Recipies, for example).
* No Updates To Starter Site: But will be adding "Field Representative Image" system field. Used for collections or compounds, any "parent" that may not have an assigned thumbnail, but which may have a child that has one. For working with the [DGI Image Discovery](https://github.com/discoverygarden/dgi_image_discovery) module for assigning thumbnails to objects.

PARAGRAPHS
* Now available for use within Islandora Workbench. Does not work with RDF out of the box. Not certain if lack of RDF support is a major issue for most use cases, if Drupal is source of truth and aren't exposing blazegraph or fedora
* Do we want to start using paragraphs in Islandora Starter Site?
  * Identifier field, with drop down for selecting Identifier Type + Identifier value
  * Notes with Note Type + Note Value. If you wanted a type of note that you could control access to it couldn't be based on a field value in a paragraph. You would have to have a separate field for "restricted access" notes.
  * Title with fields like Title Type, Non Sort, SubTitle, etc.
  * Either programmatic way of transforming Title Field into Note Title, or use Title Paragraph for alternative titles.
  * Origin Information, an interesting case if you are using Event Type for things like publication, manufacturing, distribution, etc. Otherwise maybe more trouble than its worth.

XML
* Conversation? Tools? What we love? What we hate?
* Trycia: deal with metadata now or after migration; using scripts for certain clean-ups while still in XML, so things conform to I8; types and authorities standardization; are very comfortable with XML, and know how to work with it, so deal with it now while it is still an option
* XSLT: what to take care of as a transform vs what to edit in the original XML
* Rosie: have xslt to convert to fields like workbench and then print report for fields/data that does not transform
* T: Use python for flattening
* Seth: XSLT not as good for making complex decisions, easier to do with programming (python, etc)

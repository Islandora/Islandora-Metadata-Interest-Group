### Agenda: 
* Announcements
* Review terms for resource type and Genre term ([Sandbox](https://sandbox.islandora.ca/))
* Review order of form
* Discuss moving meetings to once a month 
* Look setting up search -- talk labels -- how people manage their labels
* Investigate search options, including what each search option does. 
* Open Conversation 


### Notes:
* Announcements
	* Pitt is thinking of post migration records with MARC. Currently they are undergoing a lot of steps, but hoping to reduce that (using alma identifiers -- MMS ID opposed to barcodes). 
	* Whitman implemented Homosaurus to Islandora 
	

* Review terms Resource Type and Genre 
	* We talked about changing help text for resource type. 
	* Previously Resource Type and Genre were too similar in the help text. 
	* Resource Type (Broader term): The general nature of the content of the resource. To describe the digital or physical format of the resource, use Form instead.
	* So for Genre (Narrower term): A narrower term or terms that designate a category characterizing a particular style, form, or content, such as artistic, musical, literary composition, etc.
	* Re-ordering. We wanted to move Genre up-- so the order would be  Type-Form-Genre. 
	* Maybe adding more specific designation. Maybe having a way to direct Resource Type. Resource Type is a limited list, and genre is where we are more specific. 
	* Only tweak: [type definition] [sentence directing to genre] [then sentence directed to form]
	* *Resource Type* : The general nature of the content of the resource. To describe the digital or physical format of the resource, use Form instead. (need to fine tune) definition. Sentence directing to Genre. Sentence directing to Form)
	* *Genre*: A narrower term or terms that designate a category characterizing a particular style, form, or content, such as artistic, musical, literary composition, etc.
	* *Form*. (need to wordsmith)

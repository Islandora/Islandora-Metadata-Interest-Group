#### Notes:
* [irclog](http://irclogs.islandora.ca/2017-09-18.html) - Work was also done on Trello Board above after invitations and memberships were worked out: [invite](	https://trello.com/invite/b/J6ciWrqa/ebf3ffc9976ef458a58bc05064d30f85/sample-mods-rdf-mapping-tool).  A note in response to a question from Manitoba, this dcterms mapping is at the stage of an exercise to get us all on the same page, no formal decisions are being made just yet, but a good point was made that once we have some sort of mapping our work is much further along, and choosing specific namespaces to avoid dataloss from our MODS will come in future phases until we get a minimum viable product, which will then be customizeable for specific needs.

* Learning from Samvera: Rosie reported in from their Metadata Meeting that they've been working on ordering authors on a paper when mapping [multiple authors from MODS Names](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ta3pJB-ZGD8J88SrcC7Hr-Ox0BHNFKh5jwc0EXDKLUY/edit#gid=0).
* Documentation/Implementation Thoughts: 
  * There is basically no way to avoid cleaning up your metadata before you migrate so we should include suggestions like "Map all of your Names to URIs so that you can be cool and use dcterms:creator instead of dc:creator".  But re-written all nice and technical like.  
  * Also we can bring a good point of view to suggesting a workflow for cleanup using (Islandora Awesome) tools like [Islandora Metadata Analyzer](https://github.com/jyobb/islandora_metadata_analyzer).
* We Worked on mods:title last time.  This exercise brought us to [mods:name (author)](https://trello.com/c/GtMX3G3B/28-modsname-author), [mods:name (not author)](https://trello.com/c/K1TCWRiF/29-modsname-not-author), and [mods:typeOfResource](https://trello.com/c/OdoK1uWN/30-modstypeofresource) 
* Roles for Agents gave us pause because simply assigning a triple like <person> <is> <author> will lose context in the greater triplestore so that person could be an illustrator of one work, and author of another.  So ...we still need to clarify that issue.  

#### Questions:
* Discussion was pretty integrated in this working session, so my notes are terrible.
* Answer: "Strings not things"
* Answer: Definitions of things like Creator and Contributor are left intentionally vague in Metadata standards so that it can be a standard for many,  not the perfect answer for everyone.

#### Homework: 
* Take a look at your institutions [mods:genre](https://trello.com/c/lCfdfP6J/31-modsgenre) and come ready to discuss genre mappings.
* Make a contribution to this or any other card.

### Agenda:
* Announcments
  * Survey : http://tulane.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5h9FEY84BRbbdeR
   * Reviewed current survey results
   * Plan to close in a week and create a summary
   * Next version of the survey will list particular documents/trainings and allow everyone to put them in order so that we can form priorities
  * Victoria Day, so attendance may be light
* The Documents - Continued review.
 * [Draft Recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qSO9YcALtYSqd6CUuGx0t8FwUJ5pPwVPz0PA5rU898/edit#heading=h.f9r6knw0rjvu)
 * Will need a tool that tells us when certain errors occur (for example, if names have roles that aren't reconcilable, they will be mentioned in a text review of the migration). This allows us to map both these names and names without roles to the same contributor role term.
 * Questions about the relationships between endpoints in Drupal and Fedora.
 * How specific to an implementation plan vs. a recommendation? Intend to have a more specific set of documentation to cater to our audience.
 * We may create an expanded document/a linked document that explains particular fields in Drupal and expands the implementation notes. This may also help streamline the existing documentation by removing details that only apply in Drupal.

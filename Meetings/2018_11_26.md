### Agenda:
1. Announcements
  
1. Mapping Subjects Review
  * Already discussed: Geographic Code, minting of Geographic, flattening hierarchical Geographic and treating as Geographic
  * To be approved: Use of rdfs:label, edm:Place, and schema:sameAs where appropriate for various geographic subjects
1. Mapping Subjects Next Steps
  * To discuss: pros and cons of a few of the options visible in Samvera mapping for handling compound subjects that are not pre-coordinated
  1. Direct mapping (generally most similar to our "simple mapping"), least recommended by Samvera: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#heading=h.myfyjspdhtlh
   * 3 options available on page 34
  1. Minted object mapping (results in more functional data): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#heading=h.nc5l57edglc7
   * options for application visible on pg. 89-90.
  * Other subjects we could do initial mappings for (provided they're simple subjects): Cartographics/coordinates, cartographics/scale, topic, name, genre, temporal, occupation

### Notes:
* Announcements
  * Contacts with other groups and other research into handling compound subjects in RDF are ongoing. Other contributions of research are welcome!
1. Mapping Subjects Review
  * Reviewed previously discussion on Geographic Code, minting of Geographic, flattening hierarchical Geographic and treating as Geographic
  * To be approved: Use of rdfs:label, edm:Place, and schema:sameAs where appropriate for various geographic subjects
  * The schema:sameAs mapping will need to be reviewed by participants to make sure the mapping is appropriate, especially in the cases where one city name is used for multiple cities in different states or countries.
1. Mapping Subjects Next Steps
  * To discuss: pros and cons of a few of the options visible in Samvera mapping for handling compound subjects that are not pre-coordinated
    1. Direct mapping (generally most similar to our "simple mapping"), least recommended by Samvera: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#heading=h.myfyjspdhtlh
   * 3 options available on page 34
   * Few objects to the "preferred" version that reconciles each portion, except that we would lose the devision between various compound subjects and the relationship between portions of a compound subject. However, this would likely be the easiest mapping.
   1. Minted object mapping (results in more functional data): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#heading=h.nc5l57edglc7
   * options for application visible on pg. 89-90.
   * Since we're already minting objects for subjects, using portions of the minted object mapping may not be as difficult as it seems. We would probably want to make sure every compound subject has something like a skos:prefLabel with the compound subject string, an rdfs:lable for any simple subject string within that string, skos:closeMatch for uris that match a portion of those compounds, and something like skos:exactMatch for any subject (simple or compound) that is fully described by an authority URI.
  * Other subjects we could do initial mappings for (provided they're simple subjects): Cartographics/coordinates
    * We began discussing coordinates
     * Drupal uses this: https://www.drupal.org/project/geolocation
     * Coordinates would need to be converted to "number, number", but if they are in a predicatable format they will probably be able to be transformed in an automated process.
     * If present, a rdfs:label could be assigned based on the geographic term within the parent subject in MODS. If not present, the coordinates will become the label.
     * A spatial object would be minted for each set of coordinates. It will be assigned an edm:Place with dce:coverage that will contain the coordinates (transformed to match the Drupal geolocation requirements).

### Next meeting:
1. December 10, 2018: 
   * Subjects continued: cartographics/scale, topic, name, genre, temporal, occupation
   * Notes, description

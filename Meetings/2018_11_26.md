### Agenda:
1. Announcements
1. Mapping Subjects Review
  * Already discussed: Geographic Code, minting of Geographic, flattening hierarchical Geographic and treating as Geographic
  * To be approved: Use of rdfs:label, edm:Place, and schema:sameAs where appropriate for various geographic subjects
1. Mapping Subjects Next Steps
  * To discuss: pros and cons of a few of the options visible in Samvera mapping for handling compound subjects that are not pre-coordinated
  1. Direct mapping (generally most similar to our "simple mapping"), least recommended by Samvera: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#heading=h.myfyjspdhtlh
   * 3 options available on page 34
  1. Minted object mapping (results in more functional data): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#heading=h.nc5l57edglc7
   * options for application visible on pg. 89-90.
  * Other subjects we could do initial mappings for (provided they're simple subjects): Cartographics/coordinates, cartographics/scale, topic, name, genre, temporal, occupation

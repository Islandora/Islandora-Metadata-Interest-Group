#### Agenda:
* Welcome and Announcements

* Discussion of MODS XML as a solution (Mark J)
     * Should we stick wtih MODS XML?
     * We could continue with a mapping exercise to data we have to Drupal nodes, and keep the MODS file as a binary resource and search/index on that.
     * This depends on an XML forms module, an example of which Diego has created for 7.2(?) which may allow us to jump this hurdle.
     * The showstopper in the past was the lack of the XML form builder. Since this has been fixed, should we re-examine?
     * Wouldn't need to be exclusive. Some elements could be mapped to RDF, but all elements wouldn't need to be.
     * This could complicate the front-end display of metadata. We were expecting the nodes to work well with the RDF, but if most of the data is in MODS, there will be limitations.
     * Danny: If you keep your metadata in XML, you will miss out on all the new stuff you get for free in CLAW.
     * However, there is a middle ground that would allow you to use a node as a holder for your file that holds the metadata. Examples: ORE and EDM. This would still require some additions/smoothing over that don't currently exist.
     
* Review and discuss principles and requirements document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/19c58eqejuB3MhY-lS8o8QW0naM_R3GusD23aQ3dwusw/edit?usp=sharing)

* Begin assessment of mapping work thus far through the lense of the principles and requirements

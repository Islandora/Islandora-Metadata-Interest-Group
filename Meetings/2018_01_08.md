#### Notes and Questions:
**Attendees**: Mike Bolam, Rosie Le Faive, Robin Naughton, Wilhelmina Randtke, Christine Bone, Kate Gerrity
* General business
* Review Notes from last MIG meeting
     * Rosie will check on the missing notes
     * Using URIs as much as possible, including minting URIs
* Bibframe as an option for mapping; see MARCXML to Bibframe examples here: http://id.loc.gov/tools/bibframe/compare-id/full-ttl
     * Speaking without much authority, Mike has some concerns with the amount of Bibframe using strings.
     * Most of the group that reported has limited experience with Bibframe
     * Important to remember that we’re going to run into AACR2 vs RDA vs local decisions found in MARC fields. 
         * Important to mentally separate values entered from structure.
     * Is Bibframe designed to fit MARC and not much else?
         * Is the ontology to close to MARC? Or can it be as expressive as we’re used to for MARC.
     * Does anyone create Bibframe? Or are people still making MARC and converting? Tools for creating/editing/updating Bibframe?
     * Should we try to use Bibframe or just pick some properties? How are people implementing Bibframe right now (if at all)? Can we come to a consensus as a community on some baselines, and still allow orgs to add granularity?
     * “Snoopy on Wheels” visualized as a graph -- https://www.dropbox.com/s/1z9671jjqgjyre6/bibframe.png?dl=0 
* Possible advantage of Bibframe is being able to build off existing converter: https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe2
* Reviewed Title in BF
     * Bf:title - points to a title class object (in the example, a blank node, but we would want a URI), would allow for the full title vs. sorting title vs. any number of variant titles.
     * BFLC - Bibframe Library of Congress Extension - http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bflc.html 
* How can we handle titles
     * Simple DC 
     * DCTerms
     * Bibframe
     * Create something from scratch
* Purpose of the group
     * Brief history of the group
     * Current task - How do we deal with "MODS-pocalypse"?
     * Preparing for the migration.

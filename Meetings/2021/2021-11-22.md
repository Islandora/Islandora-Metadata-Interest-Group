### Agenda: 
* Announcements
	* [From Slack](https://islandora.slack.com/archives/CM9CVQWJ0/p1637006554026600): Local Contexts (https://localcontexts.org) is looking for an Islandora perspective on their plans to include Traditional Knowledge Label information in DOI metadata (working with DataCite to set this up). They want to have a two-hour work session to create best practices. Is there anyone who would like to volunteer? 
* Sprint Discussion and Use Cases, ([Use Cases tagged as about metadata](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+use+case%22+label%3A%22Subject%3A+Metadata%22+); [All Use Cases, ordered by heart reacts so far](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+use+case%22+sort%3Areactions-heart-desc); [Sign up for Sprint](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s5GCs9zrJsXevOulyRehpC-wdn4ShOVvEeaHDN_A2eo/edit#gid=171017277))

		* Rosie is intrigued - Experience with Prototype in DataCite DOIs. Will reach out about that, and encouraged others
		* Seth has some familiarity with Traditional Knowledge Label - related to Indiginious Rights and Access
		* Things to consider - Technical Access vs Human aspects of that access. Considering administrator rights to information?
		* Kristina will connect Rosie with asker.

* Sprint Discussion:
	* Major Topics of Sprint: 
		* Access Control and related needs; 
		* Tooling for Spinning Up Islandora (Isle, Playbook, etc.);
		* The Technical Experience, Islandora Defaults, and Expectations around those ideas. 
	* There is hope to make this as open to the community as it can be. 
		* Hoping for Daily Checkins, Subgroups, find away to make something awesome happen.
	* What is a Sprint?
		* Focused period of time to work on something. Usually used in relation to technical problem/coding. Tackle big problems hanging over heads. Often coincides with a new release with Islandora.
		* Get more features out there and get it to be more robust.
		* Dedicating time to get a goal achieved in a relatively quick manner.
	* Kristina provided a quick review of the work done during recent(ish) Metadata-focused Sprint for some additonal context to the kind of work
	* Use Cases
		* Finding Taxonomy Names by alternative or variant forms is very important for some attendees.
		* Actually, anything that allows "easier" access to alternative versions of terms, origin information for the terms, etc. would be very useful.
	* Voting is intended to show what people are interested in, but not necessarily proscriptive to what will happen in the sprint. If none of the participants are interested or able to work in the area, then if probably won't be done. The Major Topics (listed above) are most likely to have the most focus
	* Don't have to be a "Developer" to be productive - Even if you don't code, helping to create model for how taxonomies can be handled would be productive. Specifying what software should/could do is "work". You don't have to be able to code it to help design it.
	* Question about OAI support use cases - 
		* Status quo - use Kent State REST OAI-PMH - https://www.drupal.org/project/rest_oai_pmh
		* Makes islandora views (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCiQwdLWwrTNE6yToDKG3Uw/search?query=views) that allows you to expose OAI-PMH that you want. 
		* If you want OAI-PMH with DC, you are pretty set. There may have been a pull request for MODS
	* Changing Labels - making it easier to make labels so they can be changed more easily.
		* Let me change my label based on something in my metadata, rather than forcing making a whole new content type just to make a change to a label.
		*  Label element/attribute is a common feature in other library metadata standards - MODS, MARC, EAD,
		*  Where lives, how it works, how it interacts with other existing metadata, setting up contextual fields, how to make it work "easily" in the drupal environment... 
		* This leads to the importance of scoping tickets - "How much of Drupal does one need to do this work?" Helps to get around the solution being something that maybe isn't the best for uses, just because it "would work". E.g. "This could be done with contexts" even if that isn't the best solution.

* Sprint Kickoff is Monday, November 29: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s5GCs9zrJsXevOulyRehpC-wdn4ShOVvEeaHDN_A2eo/edit#gid=171017277

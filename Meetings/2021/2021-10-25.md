### Agenda: 
* Announcements
* Conversation: blockers about contributing to Github issues (contributing to metadata issues and making sure our voices are heard)
* Talking about importance of drupal fields in relation to RDF 
* Metadata slack question :  In looking to fill more specific needs from my metadata, is the RDA ontology a good, safe bet to take care of a lot of these needs? I'm seeing properties related to theses and series there that would be of use to me, and the MIG mapping seems to make good use of it. (Mapping Document [Islandora MIG: MODS to RDF Mapping Recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qSO9YcALtYSqd6CUuGx0t8FwUJ5pPwVPz0PA5rU898); Mapping Spreadsheet [CLAW MIG MODS simplified mapping](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18u2qFJ014IIxlVpM3JXfDEFccwBZcoFsjbBGpvL0jJI/edit#gid=0)

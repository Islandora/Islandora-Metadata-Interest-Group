### Notes
* Announcements
	* Kirsta happy to answer questions from other meetings/groups

* Drupal fields:
	* What is a drupal field NOT: NOT a field like MARC, Dublin Core or MODS element. 
	* What IS a drupal field: islandora is drupal with added extensions. Drupal stores data in a database. A database is an interconnected bunch of tables. 
	* Database table -- similar to spreadsheet (columns are fields in spreadsheet). 
	* Databases don’t let the spreadsheet errors happen -- you need to say outright what content goes in that field before you can add the field. 
	* Each column in a database needs to have a content field type (some field types are added by islandora for oru uses) 
	* So the labels and machine name are the fields, and then there are field types -- content that goes into fields
	* Drupal assumes there are based fields that will be added to everything (title, language, name, description are examples) 
	* RDF is a derivative of Drupal fields
	* With each transfer of data, you are bound to lose bits of information. 
	* There is a lot of flexibility on how you define your fields and field types in islandora.  However many of the options are very simple.-- though it is possible to create more complex field times. 
	* All in all, preparing your metadata for Islandora is a big project, you cannot just bring your legacy MODS in and make Islandora 8 work. 
	* Batch work, workbench entry, match edit in islandora -- it’s possible to o with I8, but it’ easier to do with simple metadata
	* Concerns: standardization for specific modules / functionalities mean you need specific fields -- example: for newspaper viewers to work, yo’d need datecreated field
	* Everyone is reinventing the wheel. We need a place to share our metadata configs, our legacy metadata to drupal fields  --create a cookbook of Islandora 8 migration content 
	* Question: Islandora defaults - institutions working around islandora defaults. You do not need to use Islandora defaults -- if defaults change you will not get those changes automatically… this is a good case to test in the sandbox 
* November sprint: 
	* Asking people to look at github cases and heart issues they like. 
	* Everyone lists what is important. First day splitting into teams, and work on tasks, mapping them to github projects. 
	* Based on people showing up, focusing on ISLE DC, documentation and “whats a default islandora experience”,  access control
	* Part of the sprint is about organizing. 
	* Open tech call is planning : planning on 17th that will architect the sprint.  (sprint is November 29-December 25th) 
	* Adding hearts: need a github account. 
	* When you click on a use case, read through it, then click on the smiley face, and click the heart. 
* Glossary terms to add: 
	* Widget
	* Composite identifier 
	* Drupal profile 
	* Pull request 
	* VM
	* Cashing

10:13:06 From  Danny Lamb  to  Everyone : i'm tinkering with it now
10:19:44 From  Charlie Tillay  to  Everyone : Early on in the mapping, we did play around with complex titles vs. simple titles.
10:24:09 From  Seth Shaw  to  Everyone : Fuller form title is the simplest to do.
10:24:19 From  Seth Shaw  to  Everyone : Yup.
10:25:01 From  Charlie Tillay  to  Everyone : Okay...note to update the other spreadsheet as well!
10:31:58 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone : Do we want to stray too far from the default?

10:35:57 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone : that's what we're working with
10:39:15 From  Charlie Tillay  to  Everyone : I would love at least a couple open work sessions...I think I'll be more likely to participate if I know I can immediately ask a question (rather than having to type out a message about what I'm seeing).
10:39:43 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone : I agree!
10:40:15 From  Mandy Ryan (she/her)  to  Everyone : Yeah, I‚Äôd love to do a set work session, even if it‚Äôs just in the beginning to get started.

10:46:04 From  Seth Shaw  to  Everyone : I still haven‚Äôt found where to change my black box.

10:46:59 From  Seth Shaw  to  Everyone : Huh‚Ä¶ still not seeing it on that page. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10:47:20 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone : "Something about the i8 metadata I realized is really bothering me - you have to define your repeating fields by how many repeats they are allowed - and you get one shot at that and can never change it.  I am horrified by both of those things - I thought defining a limited number of repeats went away with relational databases in the 90s.  And not being able to change?  Is 5 authors enough?  Do I have to do 10 and waste all those empty spaces on every record?  I don't really understand how drupal stores the metadata and I guess I need to - because what I believe are the answers to those questions are one reason I am strongly opposed to i8."
10:51:28 From  Seth Shaw  to  Everyone : All I can say is ‚ÄúCONTENTdm didn‚Äôt scale.‚Äù
10:51:39 From  Seth Shaw  to  Everyone : We got too big for it.

10:54:55 From  Charlie Tillay  to  Everyone : Thanks for these helpful pieces of information I can use in these discussion. I really appreciate this community and I do not want to leave it.
10:57:14 From  Mandy Ryan (she/her)  to  Everyone : I‚Äôm working with a few partner institutions that are all going through CMS/DAMS migrations into new hosted solutions (and unhosted) and it feels like there‚Äôs a variety of issues with all of them.
10:58:37 From  Seth Shaw  to  Everyone : Yay community development!
10:59:20 From  Seth Shaw  to  Everyone : I wonder if it is because I‚Äôm on a Mac‚Ä¶ ‚òπÔ∏è

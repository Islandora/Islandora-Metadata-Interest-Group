### Notes
* Announcements
 * Kristina walks us through one field, then use the rest of the meeting to work independently and ask questions 
* You can sign up to verify or be a reviewer on a field 
* Link to sandbox : https://159-203-41-81.traefik.me/
* First step, claim a field to verify or be a reviewer on the [Sprint signup spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s5GCs9zrJsXevOulyRehpC-wdn4ShOVvEeaHDN_A2eo/edit?usp=sharing) 
* Follow instructions on the [Field mapping verification sprint spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-L_eAaNBvnVWb05HFrnNHKM6Bn2ULDKxurB9ZXRYCpU/edit#gid=0)
	* Kristina walked us through Abstract as an example 
* After we gather the data, then we can discuss if our findings are what we want
	* Alt-title is automatically getting English language tag that is being put into RDF mapping. We may not want that. 
	* By default, drupal is assigning a language tag. The site was told to be done in English to avoid the “unknown” language (drupal needs a language).
* There is a place for a person to verify findings. 
	* How would a reviewer say that a the original person made a mistake/a field is missing? Put it in the reviewer note
* Questions that came up: 
	* Just want to clarify - for the actual vocabulary column, that would be the checked vocabulary on the reference type page? Yes. so family, corporate body, person, etc
	* Is "Actual Drupal Field Name" what the sandbox calls "machine name" ? Consider that as the Label. Updating instructions to say Label from Field list
	* Are we to edit what's in the gray columns if necessary? Or just make a note if there's a discrepancy? No, you shouldn’t be able to edit those. 
	* Agent and Linked Agent are the same thing 
* Open Office Times
	* Co-conveners  will set up a time and let everyone know via Slack channel

10:42:56 From  Islandora Foundation  to  Everyone:
	Apologies but I have this in my calendar for an hour, and another meeting at 2:00. If I have to go and there are questions or updates for me, feel free to email me or hit me up on Slack
10:43:28 From  Mandy Ryan (she/her)  to  Everyone:
	We are in the exact same place, Chris
10:44:49 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Islandora Foundation(Direct Message):
	Thank you for coming today!
10:45:17 From  Matthew Lincoln  to  Everyone:
	Is that true about islandora defaults tho? That it will be supported in some core way?
10:49:17 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone:
	I agree!
10:50:24 From  Don Richards  to  Everyone:
	I would heavily suggest not using Islandora Defaults. Instead use an install profile. Lots more pros vs the simpleness of defaults.
10:51:06 From  Matthew Lincoln  to  Everyone:
	@Don hah! If that was on the front page of the documentation, it would be cool
10:51:58 From  Don Richards  to  Everyone:
	Yeah. ISLE is switching to an install profile (if it hasn’t already).
10:55:42 From  Karen Gorss Benko [she/her]  to  Everyone:
	are there dates for the sprint?
10:56:06 From  Kristina Spurgin (she/her)  to  Everyone:
	November 29 - December 15th
10:56:09 From  Karen Gorss Benko [she/her]  to  Everyone:
	ty
10:56:39 From  Don Richards  to  Everyone:
	Install references stuff specific to a block that is likely specific that is there by default by specified theme. You can change stuff to fix those changes quickly.
10:59:44 From  Karen Gorss Benko [she/her]  to  Everyone:
	I have to head out, thank you Kristina and everyone!
10:59:50 From  David Wisniewski  to  Everyone:
	that’s a legit issue
11:00:09 From  Islandora Foundation  to  Everyone:
	Yes I have to go too. Sorry if I went on too much. Oatmeal brain.
11:00:11 From  David Wisniewski  to  Everyone:
	whenever I had developers building things they’d do ‘foo data’ and I would always tell them ‘try it with real data’

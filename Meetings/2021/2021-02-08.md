### Notes
* Announcements
	* new co-conveners  have taken reigns from Mike and Rosie (Thank you both for your service!)
	* Interested in EDTF dates? Kristina has been asking in the Slack. If have any updates or questions, that is a palace of reference
* Taking a look under the Islandora / drupal hood
	* Anyone who has installed islandora default will have this. 
	* How to check to make sure things are working. 
	* Click on the image islandora. If you go to resource url and type in ?_format=jsonld. You will get a json representation. Here you can see the mapping. 
	* To play around with mapping, in as admin, go to configuration synchronization. You can export/import [yaml files](http://yaml.org)
	* *Exporting* : select the export tab. You want the single item (full archive will give you a zip of all your stuff). From the single item, under config type there is an option for RDF mapping you want to select. On the drop down below, you want to select node.islandora_object (this is the descriptive metadata)
	* From there the yaml will appear in the box. 
	* *key to yaml* : if you see something that looks cryptic, it's best to not touch it because it's likely  system information 
	* On the yaml, there are two points you want to pay attention to: the first is Types (how you set RDF types), and fieldMappings. Those two areas are where you want to pay attention. Normally the field is the machine name of the field, too. 
	* *Importing* : From the import tab, you can import a single item, indicate that it's an RDF mapping, and past the yaml into the box. 
	* You don't have to tell islandora it's a  islandora object. It knows that. However, this is just for existing objects your editing. It uses the cryptic information on top of the yaml to figure out that it's an islandora object. New items are trickier.
	* When changing the mapping, hunt for what you want to change, and change (so changing from dc:title to schema:title you can edit on the import box). 
	* *Checking Mapping* : take something you know has XML, go to that item, and add in "?_format=jsonld" to the url to check the mapping (in yaml form) 
	* It's good to note that there is no xpath to predicate, side by side match up, because there are different processes involved. 
* How to go in and look a nodes
	* Note : this is drupal stuff, and not islandora specific
	* In your admin bar, go to structure. There are three places you want to consider, 1 Content Types (nodes ; go here to change fields on your description), 2 Media Type (Fields on media - technical metadata), and 3 Taxonomy (something not preserving through important to keep, ie entity ; go here to change entity). 
	* Looking at content type : go to the repository item. On right side there is a drop down in which you can manage fields. This will list out every field that is on this type of object. 
	* *Entity reference* : Everything you make in drupal is an entity. If you have a field you don't want to duplicate information in (say you have a collection of Tolstoy works), instead of repeating his name in the author field, you create an entity. What drupal will do is help that process by creating a type of controlled vocabulary). This is one way a controlled vocabulary is created in drupal. You'll find that Genre and Geographic Subjects also have Entity Reference. 
	* *Type relation* : this is a specific type of controlled vocabulary where relationships to an item are more specific and work on a case by case basis. Taking a closer look, if you have Tolstoy as a creator and contributor, you can use typed relation which will look at all the roles assigned. 
	* RDF mapping (for names) defaults to contributor, but behind the scenes magic happens where you use a specific predicate for different roles 
* Taking a look at field configurations 
	* In the same area (admin bar structure and select content type), you can look at the field's configuration. In looking at Extent (after selecting the edit from the far right drop down). Here, you can set fields to indicate if they are private or not (configure a field to show up for specific admin members and not to the public). 
	* You can also check this area for the field's repeatability.
	* You can make your page Translatable (idea that you want to add in different language (say French) version of your page)
	* In looking at entity reference, you can see the vocabulary being used to populate your field. You can check the vocabularies you want your field to use. 
	* Note that the Reference method near the controlled vocabulary list is for developers only. 
	
	

    
### Next Meeting:
* February 22, 2021
	* Answering questions that may have come up from today 
    * Sprint organization ([Field mapping verification sprint spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-L_eAaNBvnVWb05HFrnNHKM6Bn2ULDKxurB9ZXRYCpU/edit#gid=0))

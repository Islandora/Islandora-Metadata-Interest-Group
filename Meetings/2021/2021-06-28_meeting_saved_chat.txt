10:06:47 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone : https://www.islandora.ca/content/welcome-summer-islandora
10:10:08 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone : I think that would be a good idea! I know a few institutions who are using DC and don't have time to do the full MODS/RDF
10:12:05 From  Rosie Le Faive  to  Everyone : se “elements/1.1/ namespace” https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/

10:22:41 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone : thank you!
10:23:18 From  Bolam, Michael R  to  Everyone : Typo in the URL above (extra back-slash). Try this: https://github.com/lyrasis/islandora8-metadata/

10:29:24 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone : Is this LYRASIS content type something that is planning on being shared widely once it's finalized?
10:43:24 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone : So if you have a URI in your MODS, it will pull in the term? So http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85038796 would turn to "Dogs"?

10:49:45 From  Danny Lamb  to  Everyone : got to go, sry.  see y'all next time

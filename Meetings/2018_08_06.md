#### Agenda and Notes:
* Announcements
  * No meeting September 3 (Labor Day in the U.S.)
  * CLAW Sprint Coming Soon (August 20th)
    * Programming - Building up using Fedora 4/Drupal 8.
    * Drupal 8 - Configure site to receive the data - Metadata Profile put into Drupal. MIG folks + others work on that config creation.
* Rosie Recommendations:
  * Pushing back to a simpler form for this pass - What ships with the basic forms (e.g. what ships with the "Basic Image" form)
* Reviewed the basic image metadata form on the 7.x sandbox to see what is there:
  * https://sandbox.islandora.ca
  * https://sandbox.islandora.ca/islandora/object/islandora%3A224
  * Sample metadata: https://sandbox.islandora.ca/islandora/object/islandora%3A224/datastream/MODS
* Type of Resource:
  * Can we use DCMI Type?
  * What about Cartographic Resources/Musical/Non-musical. We'll look for a URI to use to avoid losing specificity.
* Genre:
  * Do we want to option in CLAW for choosing your vocabulary?
  * As an interface in CLAW where you can paste the URI, then CLAW takes the link and "understands" what it means.
  * How do we get from string to URI?
    * Take in as strings and figure it out (guided version), or some tool that sorts it our later.
    * Or, because of the potential vocabulary variety -- ingest as strings, and work on a way to resolve them to something later.
  * If we fail to transform the string to a URI, then can we store both the authority attribute (e.g. marcgt) and the term (e.g. autobiography)? Will ask the devs.
MODS to RDF Mapping: Type of Resource and Genre
* Any additional time after the Type of Resource and Genre discussions will be used to investigate mapping Identifier, Language, and/or Physical Description.

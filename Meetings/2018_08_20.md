#### Agenda and Notes:
* Discuss [Requests for Sprint Goals from MIG to Sprint Team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZBzkGJ-t-c224S9aHRUZmTKHJzbPGJbmzBrzF2h66Y8)
    * Including a copy of the MODS document as an attached datastream after migration was agreed to as part of the goals for CLAW (for archives and for revision of data post-migration)
    * Setting up your own reconciliation service:
    1. It should be possible to get a reconciliation going, according to this: https://github.com/codeforkjeff/conciliator
    2. Download and run command? How does it work?
    3. We may need to request some dev-side help to help us understand or run this, so we're going to create a ticket for it.
    * Review of [mapping spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18u2qFJ014IIxlVpM3JXfDEFccwBZcoFsjbBGpvL0jJI/edit#gid=0) developed for sprint
    1. We have recommendations of which vocabulary to use for relator terms and some other terms in the spreadsheet, but the sprint is exploring creating compound fields and lists for the vocabulary that will be editable/extendable.
    2. Compound field (Agent) with entity reference (URI/linked agent) and a field type (role/relationship designator). The web form will allow you to type in a string. If that string is already assigned a URI, it will automatically be assigned. If it isn't, you will need to create a new Drupal node for that person. Linked agent (URI) refers to the URI in RDF, authorized label in the GUI, and node in Drupal.

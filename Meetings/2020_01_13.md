### Agenda:
* Announcements
* Discussion: Can we/Should we develop a "recommended" or "preferred" or "default" MAP for Islandora 8? 
  * Is this something that rises above "MIG recommends the following MAP"?
  * Do we want to define a Class (or Classes) that an Islandora resource node "is" ?
  * What other problems that arose during the creation of the mapping could a MAP solve?
  
### Minutes:
* Announcements
  * Islandora Camp at UPEI July 20-22 (https://islandora.ca/camps/icamppei)
  * ArchivesSpace controlled access terms is officially a Drupal project! https://www.drupal.org/project/archivesspace
* Metadata Application Profile discussion, part 2
  * Review of advantages and disadvantages
  * Invitation to discuss MAPs currently in use
   * MAP of a kind exists, but it's in the config files; we should probably write it into a document form.
   * DPLA contribution is done according to a MAP, MWDL is an example of a more specific MAP based on the DPLA map: https://github.com/mountainwestdl/mwdl-map/wiki/MWDL-Metadata-Application-Profile
   * Mike Bolam mentioned using MAPs, but not the kinds of actionable MAPs that are in development now.
   * Pitt and PEI representatives both described a tendency to put materials in without necessarily conforming to a MAP.
   * Variance of compliance to the MAPs that exist, depending on how the harvesting or creation of metadata was processed.
   * Alternative documentation: spreadsheet templates, metadata guidelines, basing collections on other example collections
  * What decisions do we want to make for Islandora?
   * Description of the decisions made in "default".
   * By not making decisions, we're making decisions, and by not providing requirements to the programmers, we're leaving a lot of decisions in their hands. I wish we could create a best practices or examples or templates or document some of the recommendations we have.
   * Is this going to look like RDA? Is it going to be a basic out-of-the-box version? Is it going to be best practices? We're still figuring that out.
   * Is MVP minimal or minimal useful?
   * What some of the smaller Islandora users want is a product that already has a kind of a MAP baked in, one that is created and verified or supported by the users who have metadata librarians to do this work.
   * Debate about creating a new default (one that's more strict?), so there are at least 2 and so that we can go back and make stricter decisions than the original defaults without messing with metadata that is already in Islandora 8.
   * Suite of mini-profiles? Clearinghouse for profiles institutions have created for specific needs?
   * Sub-modules could extend the profiles available, so we could have them installed along Islandora Defaults.

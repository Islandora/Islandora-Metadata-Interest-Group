### Minutes:
* Survey - still only 3 responses. 
   * We'll close and take the feedback. Documentation is the major request, as well as migration tools
   * It's confusing and messy. 
* Some of this might get hammered out through documentation! 
* mods:part is often used for citation information. Do we model to BIBO? That ontology appears to be dead/unmaintained. Is that ok?
   * we might have to import the BIBO owl into islandora...? 
   * maybe set up your content type manually (Danny) since we can't auto-generate fields from an OWL file.
   * Kate found that LC is taking ownership of BIBO: http://www.dublincore.org/news/2018/11-30-bibo/

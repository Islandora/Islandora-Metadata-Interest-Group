* Issues on GitHub: Does anyone need help with issues? There's the issue with the Islandora Authorities SubGroup. We wanted to discuss them as a group and then go through the issues next month. The instructions for doing a pull request wasn't evident. Marcus gave give people a tutorial. The pull request with CLAW brings more conformity and standarization. It's best to start practicing with it and people are here to teach and share.  

* [Documentation for CLAW](https://github.com/bryjbrown/CLAW/blob/bryjbrown-user-docs-updates/docs/user-documentation/intro-to-ld-for-claw.md)

* After the conference, there will a CLAW ova available to try out all this new functionality.

* Discussion: [Feedback on Mapping from ICG](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11OpqMMCXM1TFXgsr4yyTQ_cH9DabnD31p7JnuTRQl28/edit?invite=CMWvruEI&ts=5e66437f)
  * Title seems mostly workable
  * Name concerns
   * URIs not available for all names: even if names don't have URIs/CV, there will be workable options, they'll be assigned a termID during migration
   * non-MARC relator codes: see rows 10 and 11, other terms can also be added if you're using something not availabe in [MARC relators](http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/relators.html), eg. "Advisor"
  * OriginInfo
   * EDTF widgit should address W3C, ISO8601, and edtf formatting.
   * If you're not at all sure what format your date is in, then you will probably need to create a literal field and move everything into that field as raw text.
   * You can do some date clean-up during migration as well.
   * Date attributes will need to get represented in encoding of the content instead, or you'd have to create a new field for questionable/approximate.
   * How will the characters for EDTF affect date sorting? We will figure this out.
   * Do we want a Sortable date field?
   * Publisher statement: assumes publisher of digitized item, not publisher of digital collection. Anyone using it otherwise will need to adjust mapping.
   * PlaceTerm: For placeTerms that aren't CV and are very local, row 25 can be used without row 26.
   * PlaceTerm: For placeTerms that aren't publisher (event type), the mapping will need to be customized to use prp and mfp
  * Note
   * Notes which need to be hidden would need to be assigned to their own column, for example, in pre-processing, so that they end up in a custom Drupal field.
   * Note type fields will almost certainly require customization at each institution, because there are scaling issues with very long forms with many fields.
   * Typed note also an option as per Seth Shaw, if you're interested in that solution.
 
### Next Meeting:

### Agenda:
* Announcments
  * Samvera has released [MODS to RDF Mapping](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Share documentation skeleton](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qSO9YcALtYSqd6CUuGx0t8FwUJ5pPwVPz0PA5rU898/edit?usp=sharing) with group and get feedback
  * We don't have everything in yet, but we're getting there.
  * Two questions continually coming up as we move towards completing this documentation - "What properties are we using?" & "How do we model our values from MODS metadata?"
  * Unlike the Samvera model, we're proposing going for a very "Linked Data" model.
  * The reality - We can't do everything for everybody. Aiming for a reasonable default, plus documentation for those that want to do something else. The goal is to get most of the people close, and provide instruction for others that want to go further.
  * Review of the comments : 
   * Title: [MODS to DC XSL](https://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/MODS3-5_DC_XSLT1-0.xsl) from LoC logic, as a model for forming a title string.
   * Authorized Uniform Title (example 10 - 11): At that point, we're making title entities. We want this authority URL in RDF in a way that makes sense. Similar to MIME-Type vocabularies or Extent vocabularies - but with an open-end, because we can't really pre-load all uniform titles. 
   * Name: We don't want 1000s of Emily Dickinsons. Offloading clean-up of names to external tools (like OpenRefine). Get the data normalized before trying to go in, otherwise you'll have a "mess" to clean up later. Import will naively match on string to determine duplicates. Default will treat them as entities, but a user could go into YML and modify (like just about any other field) to treat names as strings.
   * Type of Resource: We will use the defaults represented in the table in documentation for mapping.
   * Issuance & Frequency: Use of the codes - overmodeling - Predicate as ID - helps for mulilingual, but not human readable. Making using readable, maybe by using aliases? If possible. RDAU stuff: https://www.rdaregistry.info/Aligns/alignRDACan2LexU.html

Next meeting:
* March 11 -- Discuss some of the things that aren't mapped. Related Item gets the vote for scariest.

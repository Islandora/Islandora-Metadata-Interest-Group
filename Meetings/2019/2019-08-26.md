  * What is an Islandora Object? Will be shared on the CLAW call.
* Reviewing the Visual Mapping with Examples
  * IR Citation Example: [RDF](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-Metadata-Interest-Group/blob/main/Tools/IR%20Article%20Example.jpg) | [XML](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9Dof-0-RaaFclNZYWdVaklkcjQ)
* Mapping discoveries in the IR example:
  * For mods/identifier, if there is a type outside the small number of examples, we are going to the thing we did with <note>. The contents of display label or type will be concatenated onto the contents of the field. We will not alter capitalization for either note or identifier.
  * ISSNs on host item will be added onto journal metadata. ISSNs included on the primary record will be treated the same as generic identifiers. The mapping will not remove identifiers that are on “the wrong object”. To fix this, make sure to move your ISSN data under a relatedItem type="host".
  * Under Issuance, we will create a table of how we will map the six MODS values to the four LOC values. Continuing -> serial and monographic -> single unit will be our defaults. In theory, a continuing resource could be an integrating resource and monographic could be a multipart monograph, but in practice the other options are far more common. To prevent an incorrect mapping, change all of your continuing and monographic issuance terms to one of the four more specific terms. 
  * ordering (of authors) will not be preserved in RDF but will be preserved in Drupal.
  * genres and other vocabularies - it’s okay if you don’t have an external URI

### Next meeting:
* September 9

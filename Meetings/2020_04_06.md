> The PREMIS Rights entity is primarily a statement of permissions. It includes a granting agent (embedding the PREMIS Agent entity) and an object identifier; essentially deals, people, and stuff. Permissions can be time-bound with a beginning and/or ending date. Granted permissions must be expressed as acts but can also include statements of restrictions.  The acts are defined as acts that can be performed by the preservation repository.

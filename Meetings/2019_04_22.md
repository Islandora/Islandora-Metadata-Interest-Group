### Minutes:
* Announcments
  * Islandora Community reviewing Code of Conduct - [Survey available](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qOwGvTlB-8DdoMs1eQ-aGCdaNSifTKXzB7Klj620v5k) for about another month. Please review and submit. All feedback is helpful.
* Part mapping 
 * Challenge - Part has been handled differently in Islandora world than it has been handled by the rest of the world. If the thing you are cataloging has multiple parts (parts of a book, or a kit with multiple parts), that is the normal way (as much as we can tell). 
 * Mapping is going to be tricky - going to have to take a close look at your metadata.
 * "<part> is a container element used to provide detailed coding for physical parts of a resource." http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/userguide/part.html
 * Reviewed examples from MODS User Guide, which lead to more confusion. Seems to have specific rules for Newspapers, which is not what we were hoping. Looking back to the most common way of handling it in 7x? Tough to handle in RDF. Would not typically map something like "pages 3 - 6". Could potentially be done with # Uris?
 * In 7x - Scholar Form <part> is outside <relatedItem>, but it looks like it should be inside. It requires the user to infer that the part is referering to the related object.
 * MARC Elements that map to <part> (3 of them) are obscure. MARC 510$C - place in source.
 * Proposed dct:biblographicCitation; [Bibo](http://bibliontology.com/) - leaning towards the Bibo example "Just mint the things". [Bibo exmaples](http://www.bibliontology.com/content/article.html) look promising.
* Completing the simple mapping 
* Next steps 


### Next meeting:
* May 6

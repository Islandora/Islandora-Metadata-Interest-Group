### Agenda:
* Announcments
  * Samvera has released [MODS to RDF Mapping](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Share documentation skeleton](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qSO9YcALtYSqd6CUuGx0t8FwUJ5pPwVPz0PA5rU898/edit?usp=sharing) with group and get feedback
  * We don't have everything in yet, but we're getting there.
  * Two questions continually coming up as we move towards completing this documentation - "What properties are we using?" & "How do we model our values from MODS metadata?"
  * Unlike the Samvera model, we're proposing going for a very "Linked Data" model.
  * The reality - We can't do everything for everybody. Aiming for a reasonable default, plus documentation for those that want to do something else. The goal is to get most of the people close, and provide instruction for others that want to go further.

Next meeting:
* March 11

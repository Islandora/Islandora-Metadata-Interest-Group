### Agenda:
* Announcments
  * New Member - Michael Kemezis, UConn...
* Review [Draft Recommendations Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qSO9YcALtYSqd6CUuGx0t8FwUJ5pPwVPz0PA5rU898/edit?usp=sharing) 
* Continue Mapping of highlighted fields in [Simplified Mapping Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18u2qFJ014IIxlVpM3JXfDEFccwBZcoFsjbBGpvL0jJI/edit#gid=0)
  * we were satisfied by the semantic specificity of RDAU's "is succeeded by" and "is preceded by" predicates for mods relatedItem type="succeeding" and "preceding" respectively. 
  * However we were unconvinced that the rest of the relatedItem types could be accurately migrated semantically - because type="host" had been used in practice to contain information about the collection an item was in (which was done because Islandora 7 didn't provide a way to display that information as desired). The more "semantic" bibliographic definition of 'host' is a publication of which this is an element. The simple mapping, by default, will use dcterms:relation for all relatedItem fields except those mentioned above. Some suggestions will be made for alternate, more specific predicates, if the migrating team is more advanced.
  * We weren't happy with the specificity of the available RDAU predicates for relatedItem options (except reviewOf and, as mentioned above, succeeding and preceding) so will continue looking in other namespaces.
  * Discussion happened regarding how this will be implemented in practice. The relatedItem tag is a container for whatever MODS tags you desire - up to a complete MARC record. It would be nice to see this in practice.
  * We decided no mapping for mods:extension.
  
 * Next meeting: do we need holdingSimple/copyInformation? How about holdingExternal? Or shelfLocator?


Next meeting:
* April 8

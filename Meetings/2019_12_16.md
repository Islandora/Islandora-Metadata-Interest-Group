* What is a Metadata Application Profile (MAP)?
  * [DPLA's Metadata Application Profile](https://pro.dp.la/hubs/metadata-application-profile) (and introduction) 
  * [Houndstooth](https://github.com/samvera-labs/houndstooth/blob/master/m3.yml) (Samvera)
  * [PCDM Works Extension](https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm/blob/master/pcdm-ext/works.rdf)
* Discussion: Can we/Should we develop a "recommended" or "preferred" or "default" MAP for Islandora 8? 
  * Is this something that rises above "MIG recommends the following MAP"?
  * Do we want to define a Class (or Classes) that an Islandora resource node "is" ?
  
  
### Minutes:
* Mike Bolam presented an overview of metadata profiles.
  * Consensus appeared to be that making our mapping into a metadata profile would be useful as a way to present it.
  * Concerns were raised about how prescriptive we can make a profile. We acknowledge that metadata profiles are most useful when they are enforced/enforceable, because they document decisions made. But in creating islandora defaults and in creating this mapping, we are being as open as possible to allow whatever legacy metadata people have. Even if we create a "sample demo" metadata profile, it may be misinterpreted as "the official, canonical, good" metadata profile. Islandora has committed to _not_ making decisions, but providing something out of the box that works with as little modification as possible. How do we navigate this?

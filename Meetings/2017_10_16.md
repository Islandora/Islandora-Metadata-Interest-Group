* revisted that we are working through DCTerms as an example and as part of keeping our options open, but we are not committing ourselves to any particular schema yet
* Samvera spreadsheet
  * mappings to DCsubjects seems to include custom mappings (mention of 456 in urls)
  * custom-minted column shows that geographic subjects get mapped into temporal, not into subject

#### Homework: 
* Take a look at your institutions [mods:]() and come ready to discuss subject and maybe even the rabbit-like subelements.

#### Notes and Questions:
* irclog: http://irclogs.islandora.ca/2017-10-16.html
* revisted that we are working through DCTerms as an example and as part of keeping our options open, but we are not committing ourselves to any particular schema yet
* Samvera spreadsheet
  * mappings to DCsubjects seems to include custom mappings (mention of 456 in urls)
  * custom-minted column shows that geographic subjects get mapped into temporal, not into subject
  * if a compound subject has an authority, they can be handled differently
  * Christine: some library systems have trouble validating the first part of a string on its own, so that's why the loc id authorities sometimes exist with multiple subdivisions included--they're "dummy records" and can be distinguished with 667 fields
  * uris for compound subjects make mapping easier, but they make dividing out the subdivisions impractical and they're unlikely to exist for many of our terms
  * how does the system know what pieces are additions to existing subjects, and which are new subjects? (possibly the siteurl.com/dplasubject/789?)
  * Samvera is basing mappings off the idea of subjects with multiple subdivisions, but that seems like an outdated way of describing items...how else could we maintain the context of the subject terms if we didn't want to use these mass/combination terms?
  * Christine: losing context with the subdivisions if we separate the terms is a long-standing debate; we have to choose between facets and context
  * geographical and genre subdivisions of topics might be easier or better to break out than topical subdivisions
  * Mike: We could add uris at subdivision levels in MODS (if that became important to prepare for mapping).
  * Christine: Manitoba doesn't use subject strings at all in the digital library. All topics are put in the primary heading (equivalent to subfield a).
  * Rachel: I like the idea of applying the uris in MODS at the smallest level at my institution, especially if there will be a way to duplicate in Linked Data compound terms for display (while the back-end links to flat terms).
  * Many thesaurus (maybe most) won't have these complicated subdivisions.
  * Many institutions have terms that won't exist in linked data thesaurus (line 45 is an example); foreign language and local terms are both an issue with this
  * Can we add multiple skos-pref lables so we can mark both languages to have multiple official languages of a subject term?
  * If we mint our own like Samvera, we would be able to put our own translations there, but we probably don't want to do that.
  * Do we have time to add uris to our metadata before/during migration?
* We are going to keep looking at Samvera as we move on.

#### Homework: 
* Take a look at your institutions [mods:geographic](https://trello.com/c/HNkrjSxG/33-modssubject-geographic-or-temporal) and come ready to discuss geographic subjects.
* Make a contribution to this or any other card.

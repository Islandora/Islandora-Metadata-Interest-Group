#### Notes:
* irclog: http://irclogs.islandora.ca/2017-10-02.html
* Comments to catch up from last meeting: Public Notes and goals are helpful for us to advocate for metadata cleanup in our institutions.  This can carry into sharing cleanup tricks, tips and plans.  Rachel commented that the "MIK":https://github.com/lsulibraries/mik-vagrant and LSU's refinements, CRUD, and other tools offer great place to start.  Rosie commented that PHP scripts from Paul Pound are available in ____UPEI gitub?_____
* Discussion of how folks might plan to migrate and cleanup metadata. MIK is a great tool for planning, crud and oxygen can do bare bones cleanup with your choice of batch treatments.  
* Trello work: https://trello.com/b/J6ciWrqa/sample-mods-rdf-mapping-tool
* Most institutions have a mixture of content in mods:genre, not all of which will map well to dcterms:type. We may explore using dc elements:type so that we can include strings. There would then be options in Islandora we could set up to check if those strings resolve to links, so that when there was a mixture of true strings and URIs, the strings could be interpreted literally but the URIs could display the prefLable of the URI.

#### Questions:
* 

#### Homework: 
* Take a look at your institutions [mods:subject (topical)](https://trello.com/c/p8PmbGR6) and come ready to discuss mappings.
* Make a contribution to this or any other card.

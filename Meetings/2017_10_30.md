#### Notes and Questions:
* What kinds of use cases do we have? Local histories: lots of custom geographic locations (e.g. community names, etc) that people are very tied to, and are too small or culturally specific that they won't be found in any official placename list or vocabulary. Facets: We also used the hierarchicalGeographic a lot, in order to have varying granularity (e.g. city, province, country, continent) and the ability to search/filter on them. We have co-ordinates sometimes, but not for everything. 
* Like we planned to do with names, we could use things where URIs can be found (i.e. where those place names are from or can be found in an official vocabulary with a URI) and strings where strings must (i.e. use our own custom string-based place names where we can't resolve them.
* In Dublin Core, dcterms:spatial is DC Terms and takes a URI, while dce:coverage allows strings (although it conflates geographic and temporal under dce:coverage; use of that would mean we lose specificity.)
* What Samvera Does: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_YwNyRkegT9gCoIwbZAdOupEeMsCpC9FQ0BXX4E1p-A/edit#gid=0 - they use dcterms:spatial and mint spatial objects. If there's a matching URI, e.g. one from Getty, it's listed in that minted object as skos:closeMatch. Coordinates are in DCE:coverage.
* We could (should?) also make URIs for local terms (similar to how we also discussed making URIs for names i.e. "local name authorities"). 
* How much information (especially when thinking of hierarchical geographic terms) would we need to store locally? Semantically, you should only need to make one statement, e.g. "this object is about <uri for a place>" but would the system be able to extract enough meaning from that to be able to pull this up when a user searched for the country that place is in? Or do we need to include lots of predicates (i.e. replicate the Hierarchical Geographic categories in RDF). But that kind of defeats the purpose of RDF.
* We can't really go farther on Geo until that's sorted. The predicates aren't hard, but the application might be. We'll talk to CLAW on Nov 8.
* We discussed (briefly and with no firm conclusions) what it would look like if we minted our own geo objects - what templates would we use? If we could point to the "parent" in an official vocabulary, what vocabulary would we prefer? And would we include all parents - or just the most direct hierarchical parent?
* We also discussed subject_temporal.
  * Centuries (e.g. 20th century) are free-floating subdivisions and have their own LC URI's.
  * Random-looking date strings are often selected because they are meaningful in context (e.g. [placename] - [dates of a political regime]. 
  * Samvera used bothe schema:temporalCoverage (which accepts dates and date ranges) as well as dcterms:temporal for temporal events that have URIs. 

 

#### Homework: 
* Next meeting (Nov. 13) will be an open agenda with an opportunity to discuss mods:note mapping, or ask questions and make comments about previous meetings.
* For Nov. 27, take a look at your institutions [mods:note](https://trello.com/c/BDRishWv) and come ready to discuss.
* We will attempt to talk through some of the ideas we've had, and patterns in what we'd require of the software at the upcoming CLAW meeting on Nov. 8

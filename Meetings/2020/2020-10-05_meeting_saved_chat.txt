12:12:51	 From  Paige Morfitt : It was a great class!
12:13:55	 From  Rosie Le Faive : https://www.niso.org/publications/understanding-metadata-2017
12:17:38	 From  Rosie Le Faive : i love the idea of ‘validating’ technical metadata
12:19:41	 From  Mandy Ryan : Very helpful as a jumping off point!
12:24:46	 From  Danny Lamb : yeah pcdm hates us
12:27:54	 From  Seth Shaw : Sorry about any faces I was making… I’m being texted about a system upgrade failure….
12:28:23	 From  Rosie Le Faive : so there’s “output of a tool” kind of technical metadata - that we don’t want users to be able to edit - and also “human-value-added technical metadata” that’s from external knowledge.
12:29:58	 From  Meredith : For real?! Awesome.
12:30:23	 From  Danny Lamb : i love how no one knows about image headers, rofl over here
12:32:34	 From  Bolam, Michael R : I guess I’m trying to make sure we aren’t conflating FITS (which is a tool) and Technical Metadata (which is a conceptual idea)
12:34:43	 From  Paige Morfitt : Ours is a mixed bag. We removed legacy technical metadata, but also have some living in the MODS because it doesn't look like the traditional technical metadata. 
12:36:23	 From  Mandy Ryan : We've used the used FITS metadata generated by the DAMS exactly once, to check which compression algorithm was used for a particular image file. We have a separate digital preservation workflow/system where we capture the technical metadata outside of the DAMS. We do add some technical metadata to the Notes field to keep track of who has been working on objects.
12:38:13	 From  Rosie Le Faive : yes!!
12:38:26	 From  Paige Morfitt : That's what I was wondering, too!
12:38:27	 From  Lisa McFall : +1
12:39:00	 From  Kristina Spurgin (she/her) : Good distinction. Yes.
12:39:54	 From  Danny Lamb : You'd get some of all that when migrating
12:40:34	 From  Danny Lamb : But i don't know how explicit it would be.  you'd infer it from the created date in the new content, for example
12:41:06	 From  Rosie Le Faive : page 4, here, for the ‘digitization and processing model’: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmdig/sites/default/files/CRMdig-TAPP11.pdf
12:43:07	 From  Kristina Spurgin (she/her) : MODS <internetMediaType> mixes in ur-technical metadata into the description
12:43:25	 From  Kristina Spurgin (she/her) : (by ur-technical I mean the stuff that can be machine-derived)
12:43:49	 From  Kristina Spurgin (she/her) : "<internetMediaType> specifies the electronic format type, such as text/html, ASCII, Postscript file, executable application, or JPEG image. The value is generally taken from a controlled list, especially from the Internet Media types (MIME types)."
12:44:12	 From  Rosie Le Faive : ur-technical is an awesome term. Yes - it’s weird for it to be in MODS, “technically”.
12:44:19	 From  Kristina Spurgin (she/her) : lol
12:44:57	 From  Danny Lamb : is the mixing of tech and descriptive md "the end of the world" type stuff?  seems like in practice it sorta happens whether you like it or not
12:46:58	 From  Meredith : Agree 100% on the internetMediaType. We’ve been creating a MODS to RDF mapping for UTK and we’ve decided to drop all of our internetMediaType values in MODS (half the time they are wrong!!!) and rely on automatically generated values
12:47:14	 From  Rosie Le Faive : “half the time they’re wrong” - oh no!
12:47:32	 From  Kristina Spurgin (she/her) : (That's what I've found in the datasets I've worked with too)
12:47:35	 From  Meredith : This is why humans shouldn’t input this
12:47:54	 From  Meredith : And they weren’t always added - so consistency is an issue
12:48:37	 From  Charlie Tillay : And it's even harder to be consistent when you're not sure where it has been put previously/how it's been done/what the historical files were describing...
12:48:43	 From  Danny Lamb : maybe that's really what i'm getting at.  it needs to be in a consistent spot.  and maybe that spot is wtih the descriptive md somewhere?
12:49:36	 From  Meredith : But with these types of values (like internetMediaType), putting it in the descriptive metadata means it is going to be human generated, right? And likely faulty because of this.
12:51:12	 From  Danny Lamb : ok, i yield to the chair
12:51:15	 From  Danny Lamb : and stop asking questions
12:51:17	 From  Rosie Le Faive : sorry - me too
12:51:29	 From  Danny Lamb : sry, does that make me the derailer now?
12:51:44	 From  Lisa McFall : I think some of it could be how often people see needing to update/change it.
12:51:50	 From  Kristina Spurgin (she/her) : + need to be able to query over both without having direct access to Solr (i.e. what files were digitized using XYZ scanner (machine derived) by Person A (manually entered).
12:52:51	 From  Kristina Spurgin (she/her) : + would like to query for valid and well formed files (machine derived) in a given collection (human organized)
12:53:40	 From  Rosie Le Faive : yeah, there were a few where we said “this is technical and belongs on the media”
12:56:41	 From  Danny Lamb : yeah totally possible
12:56:46	 From  Rosie Le Faive : YES that’s problem solving ;)  but YES
12:56:58	 From  Seth Shaw : And you can control which fields users can edit and which they can’t.
12:57:33	 From  Seth Shaw : You can also pull technical metadata from your media to display with your descriptive metadata.
12:57:41	 From  Danny Lamb : "tell me about your awkward fields"
12:58:22	 From  Danny Lamb : which is sort of where we are at now?
12:58:39	 From  Danny Lamb : well said tillay
12:59:56	 From  Kristina Spurgin (she/her) : Gotta run to another meeting y'all. Thanks!
13:00:08	 From  Paige Morfitt : Thank you!

13:02:57	 From Lisa McFall : Poor thing :(
13:03:18	 From Charlie Tillay : I think I'm currently logged in as r.tillay@gmail.com
13:03:59	 From Martha Tenney : Sent! Can share any docs with anyone if you share your email—sorry a lot of these docs originate on school google apps which means you can’t open via the link

13:06:33	 From Paige Morfitt : I think we stopped on relatedItem
13:20:12	 From Rosie Le Faive : here’s an example yaml showing a solr-field-to-drupal-field: https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/migrate_7x_claw/blob/main/modules/islandora_migrate_7x_claw_feature/config/install/migrate_plus.migration.islandora_objects.yml#L65-L67
13:25:04	 From Paige Morfitt : I like that idea! 
13:25:45	 From Rosie Le Faive : Lisa - “option: you could make a different field for every identifier. Another option: you could make a paragraph for “identifier” that includes a dropdown (or whatever) for “type”. Another option: We could make a “new Drupal field type” that is a “typed string” (parallel to a “typed relation”)
13:28:48	 From Martha Tenney : We are using location as recommended in dlf aquifer guidelines https://wiki.dlib.indiana.edu/download/attachments/24288/DLFMODS_ImplementationGuidelines.pdf
13:30:30	 From Rosie Le Faive : do you *want* to map the URL location? i.e. are you planning to maintain all your old URL locations?
13:38:10	 From Alex K. : Got a larger question, perhaps. Just ran our first test migration and got objects to come through, but no metadata came through from our 7 site. Where do we "input" metadata mapping in 7 to get it to come through to 8? Or is that mapping/config done somewhere in 8? Or are the YML files where we do this mapping? Apologies if this question isn't on topic for the meeting at the moment :)
13:38:31	 From Rosie Le Faive : https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/migrate_7x_claw/blob/main/modules/islandora_migrate_7x_claw_feature/config/install/migrate_plus.migration.islandora_objects.yml#L65-L67
13:38:48	 From Alex K. : THANK YOU
13:39:33	 From Alex K. : Exactly, we are trying to use the migrate module but have lots of customizations
13:40:12	 From Alex K. : Feels like some broader documentation needed on it
13:40:32	 From Alex K. : Can try to work on that some as we are testing on it
13:40:56	 From Seth Shaw : As for rights statements, we have a Drupal Taxonomy for the rights statements we use and our objects use a Drupal Entity Reference field mapped to dc:rights.
13:41:07	 From Seth Shaw : We = UNLV
13:46:29	 From Alex K. : I would suggest looking at Creative Commons, RightsStatements.org at some point
13:59:58	 From Alex K. : This was quite a helpful meeting today. Thank you!
14:00:09	 From Angelina Spotts : Thank you!

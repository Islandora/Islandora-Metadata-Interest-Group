### Notes:

* We discussed Rights in a lot more detail, knowing that people have various use cases in their 7.x data including but not limited to:
  * A URI for a RightsStatements.org statement, and/or
  * The text name of a RightsStatements.org statement, and/or
  * Free text that you are comfortable replacing entirely with one of the rightsStatements.org statements
  * Free text that would require some institutional oversight/administrative work but could, if that work can get finished, be replaced with a rightsStatements.org statement
  * Free text that has been agreed upon by an institutional decision that you want to keep as is.

> The PREMIS Rights entity is primarily a statement of permissions. It includes a granting agent (embedding the PREMIS Agent entity) and an object identifier; essentially deals, people, and stuff. Permissions can be time-bound with a beginning and/or ending date. Granted permissions must be expressed as acts but can also include statements of restrictions.  The acts are defined as acts that can be performed by the preservation repository.

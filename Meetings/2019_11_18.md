  * Upcoming special topics call on the Islandora 8 call! After Danny introduced a new tool in the last call, Rosie recommended a special call to talk about what use cases we are generally using for our base ideas of resource nodes, objects and collections, parents and children, etc., how they behave and how we'd like them to behave slightly differently. Will also include a discussion of the ramifications of various models. Please contact Rosie via Slack or email if there are things you want to make sure are discussed during this call.
* Demonstration of CSV Migration part 3
  * Mike Bolam demonstrated Conciliator and OpenRefine, which is one part of the MODS to CSV import process

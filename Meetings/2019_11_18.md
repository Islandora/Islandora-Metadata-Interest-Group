### Minutes:
* Announcements
  * Islandora Slack has a Metadata Channel! - Join - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewDLgTqnOpvMAj-dcZOKh0lNTgoogcaDaAyxYevanM1Yt9fA/viewform?usp=sf_link. No link directly to Slack yet.
  * Upcoming special topics call on the Islandora 8 call! After Danny introduced a new tool in the last call, Rosie recommended a special call to talk about what use cases we are generally using for our base ideas of resource nodes, objects and collections, parents and children, etc., how they behave and how we'd like them to behave slightly differently. Will also include a discussion of the ramifications of various models. Please contact Rosie via Slack or email if there are things you want to make sure are discussed during this call.
* Demonstration of CSV Migration part 3: Mike Bolam demonstrated Conciliator and OpenRefine, which is one part of the MODS to CSV import process
  * Context [image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CS_T4LCIuu5Mx5iciXm4jEbEYa5HRlXv/view)
  * Multiple tools demonstrated. Neither LCNAF reconciliator has quite the functionality of the built-in wikidata reconciliator. Conciliator works with VIAF, ORCID, and Open Library. VIAF mostly includes names, bibliographic titles, geographic names, and a few others.
  * Neither tool works for LCSH.
  * Github for OpenRefine describes that any data with SPARQL endpoints can be queried, but the tool on the github doesn't work as described.
  * RDF Extension also described on OpenRefine Github doesn't function anymore either.
  * Christina Harlow also has an LC-reconcile tool (with a hosted version and a local running version) which can reconcile LCSH, but the tool was created as an experiment and isn't designed for use for the scale of projects we will require.
* We aren't ready to give a survey update/create a new survey yet, but we will try to discuss it at the next meeting.
* [Pull request discussion!](https://github.com/Islandora/controlled_access_terms/pull/35)
  * Import taxonomy in Drupal for MARC Country codes...can that be merged with other geographic terms? Or should the terms created locally live in a separate vocabulary?
  * Generally, the feedback is that it's safer to keep them separate...if we want to unite them, we can do that with other external linked data.
  * There is some capablility to merge terms from different vocabularies, if we do want to create fields that pull from/merge multiple fields.
  * Seth pointed out that the same term showing up in multiple fields (pulling from different vocabularies) could be confusing to the end user, but the metadata librarian consensus was that that could be resolved by collection admins choosing which fields to display or with which labels.
  * Conversation will continue on pull request or in Slack, as participants are able.

### Notes
* Announcements
	* * No announcements
* Kristina will show MODS profiling script: 
	* Link to script [islandora-data-tools/mods/ruby/profile_xml](https://github.com/lyrasis/islandora-data-tools/tree/main/mods/ruby)
	* This shows you all the MODS fields you have in a file.
	* It is written in Ruby (This process requires you to install Ruby on your computer (you can just google “install Ruby” to get it). Ruby has “gems you need to install. If you need help finding that, feel free to contact Kristina.) and you need to run this via command line.
	* The report gives you the list of all the unique xpaths , how many times there is a value.
	* Tips: 
		* if a line says “Const” it means it is repeatable (every occurrence has the same value);
		* if it says “ID” – the number of occurrences es unique each time (every occurrence has a different value);
		* and if there is nothing in that column (or blank) it means that field does not apply to either of those conditions. 
	* You may come upon issues if the file is not valid XML (non-valid MODS still works).  If it’s not invalid, it just reports what is there and not the entire file.
	* This along with [Rosie’s python script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zoTlBle17gTT_DlPq_xroUAyRmOdnfl5CpycUu5qs_o/edit#heading=h.rxz8xh350bqn) would save a lot of time for people who do not  use Spreadsheets and are migrating from Islandora 7 to Islandora 8.

* FITS and technical metadata: 
	* FITS = tool developed by Harvard that figures out what a file is and extracts metadata, expressing information in an XMl format. 
	* FITS wraps a lot of different tools up as you may be dealing with different file types (Some important tools are JOVE which supports images and pdf formats) 
	* FITs runs the tools, exports the data and wraps the xml data around it. 
	* The intent of FITS is that it makes sure the Media is the thing it claims to be and FITS makes sure the Media is valid for the thing it claimes to be.
	* FITS islandora type is it’s own thing – it doesn’t know an node you use is an image or not. 
	* If  you run FITS in Islandora it spits out an XML file. 
	* When you select to run FITS, drupal gives you a version of FITS – it doesn’t give you all the information, just the results from some of the tools. 
	* It doesn’t run all the tools in FITS if it determines that your file does not meet those tools requirements (What tools are used depends on the information that is captured and how the file was created). 
	* Be wary because there can be conflict where two different tools will claim the file is two different formats. And if so, the status would say “Conflict” in the XML
	* What tools are used depends on the information that is captured and how the file was created.
	* In some cases, you may want to run it twice to get more metadata. 
	* For catalogers: FITS is like the LDR field for MARC records. It’s important information but it’s a bit cryptic. It is resource intensive to run everything through, and would be good to leverage in the system
	* With FITS – how else would you find a corrupt file within a 1000 pg book (every page is it's own Media)? 
	* FITS reports out well formed and valid data but also is the fingerprint for the digital file (check sum). Running FITS now, you could later run process again to check checksums to make sure nothing was changed in your primary file. However, there are no tools to do that internally, and that checking would need to be a separate process.
		* Does Riprap (https://github.com/mjordan/riprap) do that? or use checksums generated by fits? Riprap doesn’t care about fits module. It just does fixity checking.

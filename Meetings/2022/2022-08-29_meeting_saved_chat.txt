12:57:55 From Devon Murphy (they/them) to Everyone:
	the one distinction I can think of is related to visual resources/art cataloging. approximate is usually with ranges or dating based on the material (using the pigment to date something) and uncertain would be a date logged on an item but it could be inaccurate (this happens fairly often with professor-created art slides haha)
12:58:10 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:
	yes, perfect example, Devon!
12:58:15 From Devon Murphy (they/them) to Everyone:
	I've basically extended these definitions to my current job
12:58:41 From Devon Murphy (they/them) to Everyone:
	you're welcome!
12:59:31 From Devon Murphy (they/them) to Everyone:
	haha
13:00:00 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:
	And I've taken to using your definition of "uncertain:" date on object says 2025 but an uncertain date might be 2022
13:01:04 From Seth Shaw to Everyone:
	Gotta run. ðŸ‘‹
13:01:04 From Devon Murphy (they/them) to Everyone:
	yes! that makes sense.
13:01:29 From Devon Murphy (they/them) to Everyone:
	circa and approximate are equivalent, yes
13:01:31 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:
	in MARC we have a "questionable" date range or a single "probable date"
13:01:43 From Devon Murphy (they/them) to Everyone:
	it's a VRA Core thing :)
13:02:46 From Devon Murphy (they/them) to Everyone:
	thank you!!
13:02:48 From Elisabeth Ball to Everyone:
	Thanks to everyone!
13:02:49 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:
	thank you!

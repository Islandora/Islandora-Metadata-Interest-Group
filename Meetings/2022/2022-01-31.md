### Agenda: 
* Review: Review all Resource Type / System Model combos as used in the install profile and determine if they are "correct"
* Discussion: Islandora Metadata Defaults -- reprioritize technical metadata as a topic?
    * Tech Call Update, from 2022-01-19 meeting: 
        * No opposition to moving forward with proposal to switch Islandora's relationship direction from media->node (i.e. Repository item), to the Drupal standard node->media ([document making the case for this change](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11PBwZgWNpN4eiUhrt1y9fxO0RBPdQ6tnSWnv-Q2mm8A/edit#heading=h.ygg3237qo8rv))
        * Summary of discussion from [2022-01-19 meeting notes](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/wiki/January-19%2C-2022): "Nat facilitated discussion about the current media/node relationship in Islandora. Currently, media points to a node, which is not normally how Drupal works. Non-Drupal behavior creates technical debt, and if this is addressed with major refactoring, a greater amount of onboarding and learning resources as well as capabilities out of the box (ex. webform) would be available to users. **Seth brought up that multifile media does have issues with metadata support.**"
    * Refresher: [Media in Islandora](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/media/)


### Notes
* Announcements
    * Sprint ([metadata documentation revisions](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/pull/2014) not yet merged) 
    * [Use Cases (taxonomy functionality, created prior to end-of-2021 sprint)](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Subject%3A+Metadata%22+label%3A%22Type%3A+use+case%22+MIG) (no update) -- how to get movement/development resources on these? 
    * Reminder: [Glossary Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cfPYFVV9qvvz2VjBRdYUN0CB7AyVDuG-GYavQ27DuBk/edit) - some terms have been added to Islandora Glossary. Please feel free to continue to add to this document. 

* Review: Resource Type/ System Model combo
   *  Born Digital profile has been modified in one of the instances. Defaults blocks in configuration
      *  https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora_install_profile_demo or https://github.com/Islandora-Devops/islandora_base_theme 
   *  Unsure where Islandora defaults will be used vs. where it will not be used. The spin ups to the sandbox are being changed (the install profile work is based on what was in Islandora defaults at one time)
   *  All work since then (MIG work we've suggested to the sandbox) is gone. The changes MIG worked on have not been merged into the software file. It would take extra work to update the install profile. The install profile relies on a combination of what you have entered in your nodes (System Model and Resource Type) which is not ideal. 
   *  Co-conveners will reach out to get more information on this. 
* Tech Call Update
   * Technical Metadata has been low on our priority list, however, in the January 13th Tech Call meeting it came up. 
   * You have the option to add Media to an item. That media allows you to upload a file. 
   * The confusion comes in regarding direction. Media points to the node in Islandora, but in drupal, the node points to Media.  
   * There has been push to change the direction, however it is not advised as it would require a robust migration path. 
   * Documentation also indicates that Media does not work as expected. 
   * When adding Media to an existing object (example FITS): you can do so under Configurations where there is an action box. These lists the individual actions you can do (and can select FITS). If you upload another media file to an item there is always a formation error (so if you want to add FITS, you are still able to upload an image which would be incorrect). It is also worth noting, that if you do not rename your media when you upload it, they will be renamed with the node and media use type which would be confusing when looking at the media list. 
* Going forward we will look further into technical metadata -- specially as systems are more likely to interact with it opposed to descriptive metadata (Resource Type excluded)

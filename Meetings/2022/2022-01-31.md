### Agenda: 
* Review: Review all Resource Type / System Model combos as used in the install profile and determine if they are "correct"
* Discussion: Islandora Metadata Defaults -- reprioritize technical metadata as a topic?
    * Tech Call Update, from 2022-01-19 meeting: 
        * No opposition to moving forward with proposal to switch Islandora's relationship direction from media->node (i.e. Repository item), to the Drupal standard node->media ([document making the case for this change](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11PBwZgWNpN4eiUhrt1y9fxO0RBPdQ6tnSWnv-Q2mm8A/edit#heading=h.ygg3237qo8rv))
        * Summary of discussion from [2022-01-19 meeting notes](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/wiki/January-19%2C-2022): "Nat facilitated discussion about the current media/node relationship in Islandora. Currently, media points to a node, which is not normally how Drupal works. Non-Drupal behavior creates technical debt, and if this is addressed with major refactoring, a greater amount of onboarding and learning resources as well as capabilities out of the box (ex. webform) would be available to users. **Seth brought up that multifile media does have issues with metadata support.**"
    * Refresher: [Media in Islandora](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/media/)

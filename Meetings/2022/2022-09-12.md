### Agenda: 
* Field-by-field discussion. Field of the week: [Field Model,  Resource Type and Genre](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk0o_0byzeHrSKst0Feval_QeVZmo2DeIP0Mk3jaaFc/edit#heading=h.7j9q7cq419g1)


### Notes: 
* Announcements
    * Titles: ASU using complex title for Title field. When it comes to jsonld, they have a jsonld converter which turns the complex title -  turning it into standard jsonld value. 
        * If there are questions about it, Seth is willing to look into this!
       
* Field-by-field discussion: [Field Model, Resource Type and Genre](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk0o_0byzeHrSKst0Feval_QeVZmo2DeIP0Mk3jaaFc/edit#heading=h.7j9q7cq419g1)
    *    Field Model (or Model), Resource Type and Genre are all related in a sort. 
    *    Model = more like content type. Put into Islandora standard object when one Drupal content model was decided upon and it was a drop-down option. It was intended to be acted upon by machines. 
    *    Genre  and Resource Type = Person-related fields. 
       
            *   Resource Type = Broad typing of things. It is out of the box and has basic terms that are equivalent to what used to be in [MODS](https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/resourceTypes.html) (also see this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18u2qFJ014IIxlVpM3JXfDEFccwBZcoFsjbBGpvL0jJI/edit#gid=25390054)). 
                
                 *   Note: MODS has undergone big changes for Resource Type and terms have expanded, however, for Islandora 8, those expanded terms were not added because they happened after Islandora 8 was already in the works. 
                     
                 *   Also, nothing stops  you from being able to add your own Resource Type field. But the out of the box Resource Type is single-valued and mandatory (the value ends up being machine actionable). There is a pull request to change this
                 *   Going back to MODS, you had a Resource Type with attributed. During your migration, you can extract what you want (so just the text, the text and the attributes, etc).
                     
            *   Genre = More specific / more specifically used than Resource Type. More flexible (you can do what you want -- make it a free-text field). And is set up with the intent of using a controlled vocabulary. 
                
*    All three are reference terms in a vocabulary (Islandora Models, Controlled Access Terms, Genres).   The intent was that all three fields are open to make your own types, adding and using terms. 
*    Limitations: 

     *    Field Model (Model) : it is up to you. New terms likely go beyond the metadata (and include more features). 
     
     *    Genre: you get an empty vocabulary out of the box. There are suggested vocabularies but MIG has not explored those yet. 
 *    Thoughts and Questions: 
 
        *    Do we want to change/improve guidance? Are there other needs? Are needs being met?
        *    Question: Does anyone in MODS  use Type=manuscript Type=collection in Resource Type along with a value?
              *   Yes ‚Äì but it may have to do with how data was exported from archives. Finding aids default may have been set up like that
              *  Some cases there has been mixed materials transformed from MARC  
              *   UNLV has several object with two resource types ‚Äì Post cards --  If display is based off Resource Type, that would be a sticky spot.
              
      *   Vocabularies for Genre: 
            * AAT is used for MARC data.   UNLV uses mix of AAT, LCSH and they were looking to purge anything that was not AAT from their Genre.  Whitman is using mix of AAT, [COAR](https://www.coar-repositories.org/news-updates/what-we-do/controlled-vocabularies/) , LCSH and localized list
        *  Are there ways to talk more about using different vocabularies that would be useful? Example: if we put up documentation on field by field bases including links to these vocabularies for use if you wanted to.
            *  It would be of interest in developing a vocabulary platform that is part of Drupal Islandora, and developing a local vocabulary as a core vocab support (Maintaining external vocabulary alongside a local vocabulary). 
            
        * How are taxonomies working a year or so from now in when people have large lists ‚Äì and will they try to record uris? 
          * It can get messy ‚Äì when you have large taxonomies, unlike MARC they can not be controlled (specially when it comes to cleaning up terms that are not used on any object) 
          
          * It may not be sustainable over time, especially looking at the evolution of Library of Congress subject headings.
       
          * Both UNLV and Whitman have experienced something breaking due the high number of taxonomy terms
          
          *  Rosie can add to the list and ask how people are maintaining the vocabulary of things.
          
          *  An [AirTable](https://www.airtable.com/) with all the metadata associated with genre terms. Unsure how to ingest that table as of yet.
          
                *  Tip: Drupal migrate framework has modules including CSV migration. It is possible to set that up to use taxonomy terms. You could also use Islandora Workbench which allows you to migrate rich taxonomy terms. Mark Jordan added a [new](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench) feature [and](https://mjordan.github.io/islandora_workbench_docs/creating_taxonomy_terms/) that allows you to add terms and uri. 
                
                   *  For Workbench, you can import and update things. Possibly export taxonomy (fix in OpenRefine). And would update existing terms and use [reconciliation](https://github.com/cmharlow/lc-reconcile), however, reconciliation works best with names. Complex subjects are its own challenge because you'd have to separate them and join them.. 
                   
                   *  UNLV was working on a merge system however it needed human review. They use excel to manage uris and taxonomies using a s script to update terms and items to updated node ids.  [Darnelle](https://www.unlv.edu/news/expert/darnelle-melvin) would know more and you‚Äôd need to do that all on the back end.
                   *   There is an [open ticket for managing taxonomies](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1899)
                  
       *   Taxonomy management: 
      
           *    There is a taxonomy manager on Github. And Drupal 9 has merge capabilities however, it was built for Drupal 7 and may be broken. But it is worth testing on larger taxonomies. 
           
           *    Is there real-world use for hierarchical taxonomies? Or is that more organizational?
          
                   *   In theory, you can have your facet tree where the parent term would show the child within that hierarchy. Taxonomies have been displayed as trees before AAT and MESH which are already a tree and could potentially be made into a taxonomy tree. However, once you get a few thousand terms in, it may become very difficult managing your terms and the hierarchies.
                  
                   *   There are uses for it. Example ‚Äì geographic location. However, that hierarchy is complex and not like a single parent (so complex that process was scraped)

### Notes: 
* There were no announcements this week.
* Fields Of The Week: [Subjects](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk0o_0byzeHrSKst0Feval_QeVZmo2DeIP0Mk3jaaFc/edit#heading=h.gihaqb4pj3rh)
  * See the linked document for the outline of the topic. I'll record here comments and notes that moved outside that document.
  * How To Do Keywords? The use case was for a collection that did not want to use formal vocabularies, but just locally created terms.
    * One option might be to use the existing Subject fields but create new Vocabularies that did not connect to a specific Authority. "Subject" does not have to be formal. Existing vocaularies could also be used, with the authority ignored or set to "local" or "other"
    * Another option would be to create a separate Keywords field. This could be used in the place of the Subject fields, or alongside them. School of the Art Institute of Chicago kept Subject fields connected to authorities, and created a Keywords field for terms sugested by student submission or just for terms not included in official vocabularies.
  * Formatting on Coordinates (field_coordinates) field: Two values, Latitude and Longitude. Enter either in decimal 51.47879 or sexagesimal format 51¬∞ 28' 43.644"
  * Tags: Drupal field (not used by Islandora) intended for the type of simple tags used to organize blog entries or other content used by non-GLAM digital collections.
  * Authority URI: Will not display on Metadata Display (by default). Vocabulary terms are linked to a "Term" page which displays objects using that term. These can be customized to display the Metadata Fields for that Vocabulary, so the URI could be displayed here. Might also be displayed elsewhere with customization.
  * What Is Missing? What More Do We Want?
    * Dani brought up Name Changes within a collection. Some objects may have an earlier version of a name (pre-marriage for example) while others a later version. It would nice to be able to link these terms together. For example "(see also)" text in the display. Or clicking on a term would take you to the results of both terms. Redirecting on search might be confusing to users.
   * Michael brought up a frustration with Compound Subjects in Modern.
     * Feels long strings can be confusing to users and don't allow for browsing to more general terms
     * Paragraphs could be used to create the basic structure, but it is still hard to custom change the arrangement of terms depending on the need of the compound
     * Stated a wish that he'd imposed a more Dublin Core structure (single terms, no compounds) on his collections earlier, but much metadata comes from MARC where compounds thrive
     * The loss of some of the specificity in moving away from MODS
* Other Business
 * There was no other business, so we closed until the next time.

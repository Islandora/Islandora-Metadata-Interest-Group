13:59:25 From  [CoC] Amy Blau (she/her)  to  Everyone:
	My understanding is that it takes developer work to change it, and that wasn't our highest priority.
13:59:41 From  Ali Konieczny, Health Sciences Librarian  to  Everyone:
	I'd love to see more details about global updates to person names, authors, etc. The accidental duplication with changes in characters seems worrisome

	In Islandora - making global updates

	Thanks so much for the demo!
14:12:16 From  Yamil (he/him)  to  Everyone:
	what about reversing the order. Add the second term first, then second delete the first term?
14:12:37 From  Ali Konieczny, Health Sciences Librarian  to  Everyone:
	That was great!
14:13:27 From  Yamil (he/him)  to  Everyone:
	that way you can use the old term page for longer to slowly delte. but they are now giving you the bul editor if you can create a view

10:27:41 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone:
	Also good to note, the delimiter can also be changed with Workbench. It just includes some tweaking
10:29:29 From  Bolam, Michael R  to  Everyone:
	https://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/userguide/origininfo.html#agent
10:33:08 From  Rosie Le Faive (she/they)  to  Everyone:
	is Agent repeatable (within a single originInfo)?
10:34:57 From  Seth Shaw  to  Everyone:
	Side note: regarding facets based on relators, ASU uses some custom code to do it. I believe the Islandora search solution is more generalizable.
10:36:50 From  Bolam, Michael R  to  Everyone:
	Just tested it in Oxygen and Agent is repeatable within an originInfo.
10:38:01 From  Bolam, Michael R  to  Everyone:
	Note that role/roleTerm is also repeatable within a single agent, which might need to be considered when mapping this field in the future when people actually have MODS 3.8
10:41:01 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone:
	In MARC, it looks like you can repeat relator term (at least in 700 field)
10:44:51 From  Rosie Le Faive (she/they)  to  Everyone:

10:54:45 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:
	it makes sense to me -- UT Austin has yet to migrate, so we are doing a sort of similar thing, cleanup alongside our (eternal) mapping and building of our instance. I've had to do a lot of validation and reconciliation over the past 3 years so i'm happy to share anything that's helped me with you Harriet (or others)
10:55:23 From  Harriet South  to  Everyone:
	Thank you, Devon! :)
10:55:46 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:
	yw :) you can reach me on slack or at devon.murphy@austin,utexas.edu
10:59:02 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:
	yes, we're just treating it all as a string as well -- whatever is in the term as we see it in the authority, is the string we're using
10:59:16 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:
	so for the getty sometimes that's a LOT of content lol in ULAN
10:59:28 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:
	YEAH
10:59:29 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:
	hah
11:00:14 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:
	bye thank you!

	That's what jhu did as well for copyright and use

10:17:55 From  Michelle Janowiecki  to  Everyone:
	that's my understanding too Kristina
10:18:43 From  Islandora Foundation  to  Everyone:
	We did a lot of work on dates because we had trouble with sort not sorting correctly
10:23:13 From  Rachel White  to  Everyone:

10:25:59 From  Islandora Foundation  to  Everyone:
	Yes! We had something very similar with keydate.
10:30:50 From  Islandora Foundation  to  Everyone:
	For date ranges, we all decided to sort by the first date. So whenever we have a date range, we always sort by the first date (though for "unknkown-1943" it sorts by 1943 which looks really funny)
10:30:56 From  Michelle Janowiecki  to  Everyone:
	also for programmatic date clean-up, python's date.isoformat() is great too
10:39:43 From  Islandora Foundation  to  Michelle Janowiecki(Direct Message):
	Hi Michelle! Do you have a link for the python's date.isoformat() you mentioned? I want to make sure to add it to our notes.
10:40:00 From  Michelle Janowiecki  to  Islandora Foundation(Direct Message):

10:48:56 From  Islandora Foundation  to  Everyone:
	Did you use OpenRefine?
10:50:14 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:
	I use OR pretty frequently, including for date clean up. honestly use just GREL or Python in there anyway, I think it's just a nice visual organizer for me more than anything else
10:50:21 From  Michelle Janowiecki  to  Islandora Foundation(Direct Message):
	it does!
10:50:26 From  Michelle Janowiecki  to  Everyone:

	if anyone wants to look at my dates to edtf conversion, you can look at this (column g, h). https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OUfldI_FMxriIQ-nhHn8OImf5wOxdwoCjFu21G-vJ1s/edit?usp=sharing
10:59:43 From  Michelle Janowiecki  to  Everyone:

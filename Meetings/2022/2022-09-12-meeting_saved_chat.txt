	Here is the LOC page for the Schema main terms: https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/resourceTypes.html
10:15:57 From  Ross, Staci L  to  Everyone:
	There have been times when we had different record types (like "mixed material") from data we transformed from MARC
10:16:34 From  Rosie Le Faive (she/they)  to  Everyone:
	Here is the larger list of Resource Types. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18u2qFJ014IIxlVpM3JXfDEFccwBZcoFsjbBGpvL0jJI/edit#gid=25390054
10:18:46 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone:
	We use a mix of AAT, LCSH, and a local list.
10:19:19 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone:
	We also use COAR
10:19:26 From  Rosie Le Faive (she/they)  to  Everyone:
	MARC genres: https://www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/marcgt.html ?

	?
10:21:02 From  Ross, Staci L  to  Everyone:
	lol!
10:24:24 From  Bolam, Michael R  to  Everyone:
	That was the word! Taxonomies!!!
10:24:56 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone:
	As of nor, our large list is already out of control because there is no dup-check built in and it's so easy for it to get messy.
10:27:20 From  Ross, Staci L  to  Everyone:
	Sorry it's been hard to keep track of, but this is very helpful to know, Paige!
10:29:04 From  Islandora Foundation  to  Everyone:
	https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench
10:30:10 From  Rosie Le Faive (she/they)  to  Everyone:
	documentation for workbench with "rich" taxonomies: https://mjordan.github.io/islandora_workbench_docs/creating_taxonomy_terms/
10:31:07 From  Paige Morfitt  to  Everyone:
	I wonder how that would work with the use of nodes in Islandora?
10:33:58 From  Rosie Le Faive (she/they)  to  Everyone:
	FYI: open "use case" ticket for managing taxonomies: https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1899
10:34:09 From  Bolam, Michael R  to  Everyone:
	https://github.com/cmharlow/lc-reconcile
10:34:54 From  Bolam, Michael R  to  Everyone:
	You should use the "run locally" instructions - but you need to make sure you have python set up properly and all that...
10:41:38 From  Ross, Staci L  to  Everyone:
	As Seth mentioned, hierarchical taxonomies can be used to leverage broader/narrower terms in facets or discovery. However, I haven't really seen anyone take advantage of this either

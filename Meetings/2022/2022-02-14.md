### Notes
* Announcements
	* Changes for the documentation sprint have been merged into the documentation.
* Born Digital feedback on Install Profile
	* There are two fields – [Resource Type and System Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EI03VIcAPM300vzkluZAm1Is-Set3eqJMA3Ywr_s-B4/edit#heading=h.gbpx1fiuo9mb). And together they dictate the Object Type (the way the viewer/how an object is displayed/configured) 
		* Display Hints, Resource Type and Media all dictate how resource is displayed.
		*  Media type dictates how an item displays
		*  This is a trigger. That’s all it is. It’s not really metadata.  Trigger to enact an action
		*  Display Hints is supposed to dictate that (Why is there redundancy --- why do you need Display Hints and Resource Type to tell the system it’s a video player
	*  [MIG could use this to propose a recommendation](https://gist.github.com/kspurgin/b30cd26ae40cc2844a8190cca87bd404). It seems like the only reason for this field is to create collections. Other things can be determined elsewhere. And that could a check box (as compound objects are technically collections not compound objects).
	*  We could do a pull request to ask Resource Type to not be used in this way.
	*   To populate this field – institutions would need to either create an entirely new field, or completely revamp their existing Resourse Type field (removing their metadata and populating it with Islandora Controlled Vocabulary terms to comply with the use of this field) – this is a lot of (unnecessary) work for librarians
	*   Resource Type may have been a requirement to call different pages – there might be hard-coded values we’d need to look into before we think about removing this field. If we want to change the install profile – you can change defaults and not impact people moving forward. Install profile is the initial profiles with config files. And once you update a config file it overwrites everything else.
	*   The theme should not be dependent upon the descriptive metadata
	*    Rosie and Don can bring this up in the Tech call. Pull requests on this would be much welcomed, too!

### Notes
* Announcements
	* Still waiting on Pull Request on Resource Type/System Model
* [Python Script to transform XML to MIG's MODS]( https://github.com/rosiel/xml2workbench) (Rosie)
	* Took the MIG simplified mapping and created this
	* Hope to have straight-forward python file that anyone could use it.
	* Script does not validate EDTF dates, but workbench does (so double check your date range before ingest into either workbench or ingest)
	* You wold still need to do manual clean up once the csv is generated to get it ready for Islandora 8
	* There is also [documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zoTlBle17gTT_DlPq_xroUAyRmOdnfl5CpycUu5qs_o/edit#)
	* Is there a report you can run in MODs to give you all your MODS field? Kristina has a [Ruby program](https://github.com/lyrasis/islandora-data-tools/tree/main/mods/ruby) that can do that and will demonstrate at our next meeting
* [Technical Metadata spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OqlXsjKOosILo2A9LukMbZVxggrwEiAaNSpbm3u-OQk/edit#gid=0)
	* It is finished! 
	* Findings: 
		* There is inconsistency in the help text provided. 
		* FileType = File : The naming conventions are not consistent. So with different media types the file name is not the same. 
		* Use/purpose: This is used so you could index. For now that is the way to get something indexed. 
		* Auto Generated fields: This happens for images as drupal runs this.
		* Remote video Author Name:  This is only used once. It is coming from Drupal itself. The ideas is part of your import comes from YouTube or VEMO and it would pull in their metadata. And the idea was that someone from drupal decided to add this field
		* Original name: Why is that box so big? When you upload a file into fedora, there needs to be some transliteration happening. So file name would not be the original as you handed it to fedora, and you wanted to preserve the name. This is likely for Born Digital use. And as of now, you likely need to add that manually;to capture full original file path AND the original file name.
	* What are our next steps? 
		* Maybe suggest help text when there is no help text- making sure the help text actually explains what it does (Could go through and see if the help text actually tells us what we need to know)
* Look at spreadsheet between now and next meeting and see what is missing on the different types of media.

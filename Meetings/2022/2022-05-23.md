### Notes
* Announcements
* Metadata Brain Dump (Filling out documentation. Below are selected comments)
	*  Linked fields in Islandora (Links in Islandora 8): 
		*   Whitman  had text and link in same field. Moving to 8 we couldn’t have that. This resulted in us having multiple Rights fields (a text field and a link field) as well as work to clean our rights field. 
		*   UNLV uses taxonomy that allows you to have more control on how that displays. It all depends on your entity view. But there are a number of ways to go about doing this. 
			* JHU did something similar

	* Dates: 
		*  Hopkins : coming from DSpace have date created and date issued field. Working with BD (Willow) to look at those dates and automatically finds earliest date and adds to solr enable sort by date. 
			*  The use of Python script also helped. (https://github.com/mjanowiecki/metadata-editing-python/blob/main/reformat-values/convertToETDF.py) 
			*  In a clean up process, put all dates in a spreadsheet (Google Sheets), and sorted, then did a lot of find and replace to clean up, then ran the Python script to help in that clean up
		*  Google Sheets does use regular expressions which could help, too. As does librioffice calc (https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/)
		*  Devon uses OR pretty frequently, including for date clean up. They use just GREL or Python as a vicual organizer more than anyting else
		*  How was circa mapped? Was able to identify when circa was used in metadata and converted (so circa was used for decades and converted that to list the date range for the decade). 
			* If you have two different dates, you can create an aggregated index. UNLV uses this for faceting which joins fields together. However this would not work with Sort date. 
			* If you want to sort your dates, it is important to clean your metadata in order for it to work (garbage in, garbage out). The better metadata you create, the better it will look for people using those collections
		* One common issue regards items with no date: should it sort before or after everything else. With range regarding serial that is currently published, where do you sort that? With circa dates, how do you sort that? 
			* Asking for some type of date is better than nothing, even if it’s a wide range of approximation. 
		* Colgate has vender created metadata which comes with a variety of different formatting for dates.  With display problems, dates are typically the first thing people see. (Colgate Double date Histogram: https://digitalcollections.colgate.edu/collections/colgate-university-student-newspapers?islandora_solr_search_navigation=0&cq=catch_all_fields_mt%3A%28willow%20path%29)
		* Having multiple dates in your data may have your metadata creators feel better. You are creating a structured date for sorting, but we want to present something that is more human readable. 
			* Relating to MARC records, you have several fields for date (005, 260/264, 362, 65x |y...), a encoded date field, a field where you can write out the date as it appears on the item and others
			* In UNLV, and ArchivesSpace integration – they have start, end and date expression fields. The date expression would be what you display for people. However, work on this integration to drupal means a little adjusting to make it work with solr. --  Is this a compound field? a single field (in drupal a field can have multiple properties).  
		* 	Seasons and quarters: 
			*  	Use of “Winter” or “3rd Quarter"in testing in the Sandbox (in March) with EDFT display, those were not take care of/they were outliers
			*  	Chris will submit a ticket as it did work at some point (old sample document https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cx2KTkELqCDxczIVQw6La_PTSgmqMj_KEr6dIKvszYg/edit#gid=0) 
			*  For programmatic date clean-up, python's date.isoformat() (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.isoformat)  is great

* Fields Of The Week: [Identifiers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk0o_0byzeHrSKst0Feval_QeVZmo2DeIP0Mk3jaaFc/edit#heading=h.g8934y7u2a3w)
   * Standard Identifier fields include: Identifier, ISBN, Local Identifier, and PID, along with fields categorized as "Classification" such as Library of Congress Classification, Dewey Classification, and Classification (Other)
   * All built in identifier fields are string
   * All identifier fields are repeatable except for PID, since it was intended to hold a PID from an Islandora Legacy system
* Other Identifiers
   * NID: Node ID : identifier for a specific node in Drupal
   * UUID: Universally Unique Identifier : long strings of characters and numbers; more complex and unique than a Node ID
   * Other potential Identifier fields: ARK, DOI (minted by an external system that an institution maintains, no built-in updates)
   * Merging Collection ID with Object ID, to contextually show the place of an object in a collection
* What other Identifiers are institutions using?
   * Users can feel very connected to their Identifiers
   * Keeping PIDS can make it easier to compare a legacy site to the migrated system
   * Using PIDS to create URL alias' to keep URL the same between legacy/modern
   * Easily identify objects in new system when reference is only PID from legacy system
   * Handle
     * PALS: one of our libraries is using Handle.
     * Boston College manages a handle system that points to Legacy, mirador viewer. Trying to explore best options for persistent identifiers. Likes the ARK system
   * Any weird things you have been recording as identifiers
     * SAIC had brought over CONTENTdm identifier information, which was discarded for modern.
     * File names at times as identifiers for media
* Typed String field for Identifiers?
   * The possibility has been discussed in past [https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1006]
   * A single identifier field with a relator term to name the specific Type of identifier
   * A single repeatable field, rather than unique fields for each type of identifier.
* URL and URI
   * Aliases
     * Out of the box Nodes are given a URL alias, possibly the Title of the object
     * But aliases can change, killing the old alias unless you use a module like redirect
   * URI as identifier
     * When talking about our data as RDF, the drupal URI is the identifier for that object in RDF
     * Domains can change, which means URLs can change
     * We tend to depend on URIs, but they are still not as permanent
* Are there anything we'd like to see come to Islandora in regard to identifiers
   * Can an Identifier be meaningful? In I7 PIDs are incremental, so you at least get a sequencing of objects by creation date. But can they tell you other things about an object
   * Michael Bolam from University of Pittsburgh mentions wanting an identifier that has as little meaning as possible. They have had user created identifiers which has not worked well in combination with more automated systems. They now require that that type of number gets put into a separate field for "created" identifiers (accession number, etc). Also they chose PIT as a contextual prefix, even though now many of their digital 
   * Rosie has worked with systems that have those "meaningful identifiers", but things change. Could there be "human readable" that is not stored as the Identifier.
   * Keeping separate contextual identifiers from more permanent identifiers.
   * Using a contextual prefix, UPITT chose PITT, even though many items in digital collections do not to the University
* Drupal Field Validation module (https://www.drupal.org/project/unique_content_field_validation) which may help prevent duplicate field values in a collection, to not have duplicate identifiers
   * There are some types of identifiers that would allow duplicate values like an OCLC number that applies to multiple states (FRBR). 
   * Are the identifiers describing the digital object or the physical object that may have been digitized

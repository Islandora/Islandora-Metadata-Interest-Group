### Notes
* Announcements
	* Interested in in-person meeting? Yes! August 3rd we will have a hybrid meeting.  
	* Co-convener update 
		* Kristina is stepping down. Rosie is stepping in. 
		* If anyone is interested, let Rosie or Paige know!
*  [Metadata Brain Dump document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_--RimkzV5Hh6o9Gc_h4o8MC5gDVH5eI59jR_vIGEoY/edit)
	* We've collected a lot of information on this document. Feel free to continue adding to it!
	* Next steps would be to look at action-items such as creating documentation, writing a ticket, or doing a sprint based based on 2-3 items on this document
	* Dates could be tackle-able. 
		*  Kristina has a [Ruby application](https://github.com/lyrasis/islandora-metadata/blob/489c551bde1c2bf79bf7c857bf44f16d2a3d5107/mods_migration/altRepGroup_script_lang.adoc) that could be of help. This wouldn't hook directly to Islandora, but it could do some remediation, specifically with EDTF (this is doing remediation before you migrate into I8. 
		*  What do we want to express with dates? 
			* Unknown dates, vague dates. Addressing historic usage of dates and how we rectify it (lokoing at cataloging, special collections, and archive rules vs. someone who does not understand date rules. This alco includes dates spelt out in non-English languages)
			* Looking at format:  what date created, what date digitized, what date expressed is. 
		* Metadata people understand what we want via dates, but systems people may n oknow. It's important to make our needs explicit. Metadata specialists are the bridge on how different librarians think of dates. 
		* Has anyone looked at EDTF sorting outside Islandora? 
			* Rosie can look into EDTF sorting. 
			* Drupal has date fields you can index to solr. It's unclear how Drupal out of the box regards date faceting. 
			* EDTF date index is only a string. It does not support faceting or sorting in any meaningful way. 
		* A date-ccheat sheet would be helpful, however there is no one best practice. You'd have to talk about trade-offs and decisions on what you wnat dates to do within your institution. 
	* Documentation 
	 	* For our documentation it would be good to have things searchable.  
	 		* If we draft something in google doc, we could make pages to add to GitHub later.
	 	* There are available [cookbooks](https://islandora.github.io/documentation/user-documentation/extending/), however they are systems heavy. 
		* In documentation sprint last December we talked about the documentation pages which focused on how metadata works within the system opposed to documnetation that is more aimed at metadata librarians/content creators who are looking at how to use tools when they don't necessarily need to understand the system aspect
		* Should we start formatting something into major/minor headers? Would it be good to create headers of the brain dump document and flesh them out? 
			* This could include recommendations and things we've learned or trips ups/things to look out for.
* [Metadata field report demo](https://github.com/rosiel/metadata_field_report/)
	* The code is in slack
	* You are able to download reports, and add them into a CSV!

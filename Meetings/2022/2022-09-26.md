### Agenda: 
* Announcements
* Requesting the creation of new features:  [Workbench needs `update_terms` and `delete_terms`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VRNV5utqDy5pIC_U6CnMdCLRuJ0OiPBInMLHlQBVOjo/edit#)
* Continue discussing Taxonomy Management
  * "[Taxonomy Manager](https://www.drupal.org/project/taxonomy_manager)" Drupal module ([issue](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1900))
  * A View for managing taxonomy vocabularies/terms ([issue](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/2172), from [original thread](https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1899#issuecomment-926135325))
  * Hierarchy in Taxonomies in Metadata
  * Alternative to using Taxonomy Terms: [Linked Data Lookup Field](https://www.drupal.org/project/linked_data_field)


### Notes: 
* Announcements:
  *  Hurricane Fiona hit Prince Edward Island over the weekend and caused province-wide power outages. Our Island colleagues look to be okay and looking forward to having utilities returned soon.
* Requesting the creation of new features a discussion of use cases:  [Workbench needs `update_terms` and `delete_terms`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VRNV5utqDy5pIC_U6CnMdCLRuJ0OiPBInMLHlQBVOjo/edit#)
  *  Not In Scope: Question was raised about the specific use case of **merging terms**. This would be a case where Term B was merged into Term A, so Term B would disappear and be replaced by Term A in all nodes.
  *  Are institutions recording URI or authority information in vocabularies? How are you managing the data? SAIC planned to slowly add information, as time allowed moving forward, no existing data to start. UNLV had a lot of URI already in metadata from CDM; during metadata remediation did a lot of scripted lookups to clean-up before migration. Clean-up since migration, updating in Islandora UI rather than via spreadsheet export and import. Whitman is only just now thinking about adding URI manually
  *  **Unreferenced Terms Clean-Up**: Use case of cleaning up "unreferenced terms," terms that have been deleted from a Taxonomy Vocabulary but still exist with nodes. Currently when you delete a term from a taxonomy, all references remain in the nodes that include that term, they just don't display. For example, Linked Agent only the Name is deleted, the relator remains, if a name is deleted from Vocabulary. There is interest in some form of clean-up tool to catch these unwanted echoes.
  *  Chris had done some small examination "[Taxonomy Manager](https://www.drupal.org/project/taxonomy_manager)" Drupal module in D8/D9 and it appeared that almost all features from D7 had been removed, leaving on Add, Delete, Export, nothing really more than standard Taxonomy management.
  *  **Migrate terms between vocabularies**: Because vocabulary metadata got more complex in D8/D9, that feature was dropped from Taxonomy Manager. Possible to move a term, but the fact that you can have unique metadata applied to a Vocabulary that does not exist in another Vocabulary, makes it too complex to work at the moment. Seth had used scripts at UNLV to do something similar, but it involved creating the term anew in destination Vocabulary, and then scripting updates to the records, replacing one node reference with another.
  *  **Export vocabulary**: Use views for this functionality right now
   *  Seth worked on a Workbench update earlier this year that can do a node export based on a view! Create a view with the fields you want and then export that data
   *  Views are a way of building in a visual way a SQL Query and then use plug-ins to control how those results are displayed when they come back to you. Are tools to build complex joins. Context filters. 
  *  **Deduplicating terms**: Drupal is not looking at the term, just the node ID, so it doesn't recognize that two terms are the same. Maintenance tool within a Vocabulary to more easily recognize rather than visually identifying? Deduplicating terms between Vocabularies? 
  *  Use case for migration brought up in regards to separate Subject taxonomies and moving from general to name, for example. Seth mentioned UNLV discussions on wether Nevada was a State (Geographic) or a Corporate Body (Name). Staci said it is Both!
  *  **Vocabulary Usage**: Some way of finding use of taxonomy terms? Views? Views does have an aggregate feature. Seth has not been able to do in views yet. May need to be a separate code thing? A back-end script? Similar to Facet Pages in I7?
  *  The question was asked **How are Terms sorted?** On an object, you manually establish order, default the order they were entered. Is there a way to establish order during spreadsheet ingest? Whatever order they are in within the spreadsheet cell, manually.
  *  **Is there a limit to the number of nodes?** Is there a limit to the number of terms, etc.? Technically it should go up to a massive number, since it would just be an integer. Seth checked, 9-zeroes to work with. 4.2 billion looks like. **Maximum 4,294,967,295 nodes or terms**

    
### Next Meeting:
* Oct 10, 2022 and Linked Agent?

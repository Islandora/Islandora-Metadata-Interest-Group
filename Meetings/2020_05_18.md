### Notes:
* Announcements
* Discussion
  * Review of comments in the [Wants/Needs/Questions Open Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Kpb6826TNPzzMuyPS0sESa9TLnmljQmeioWbaPeEdA/edit)
  * There is a general need/desire to be able to flatten XML, for use in CSV or OpenRefine.
    * https://github.com/markpbaggett/complex_xml_to_openrefine
    * For re-combobulating back into MODS: UTK Cataloguing has a [MODS Export Template for Open Refine](https://github.com/UTKcataloging/tenncities/blob/master/cleaned_data/remediation_files/open_refine_template.md). 
  * Need for Date Transformations from another format (or unformatted) to EDTF.
    * The EDTF Widget code includes some [validation and transformations](https://github.com/Islandora/controlled_access_terms/blob/8.x-1.x/src/EDTFUtils.php), but we don't yet have a full solution for general EDTF Date transform
    * K. Spurgin shared a [Date Parser Ruby Spec](https://github.com/lyrasis/mdmm/blob/master/spec/mdmm/date_parser_spec.rb) to describe some transforms that will be necessary from their end.
    * Rosie proposed an unformatted version of such a spec document: [Date format transformation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y3NGatF2qm06vwTQbGPGdf9B23aSmTq2S8LFl-AZ8og/edit)
  * What level of EDTF is supported?
    * https://github.com/Islandora/documentation/issues/1364
  * Ongoing problems include the ability to "remove empty nodes" when sometimes empty XML nodes have attributes that are meaningful, for example in Copyright MD. 
  * The mapping in the "migrate_7x_claw" module is waaay behind, and we should work to bring it up to date.
  * Can we do a sprint to deal with some of these metadata issues?

### Agenda:

1. Discuss experiences with CLAW, XML2CSV
1. Explore OriginInfo

### Notes:

1. Experiences with the sprint, XML2CSV
  - Rachel has a document on creating a CLAW sandbox for beginners. It includes formatting an old computer to have Ubuntu as its Operating system, and installing the requisites for CLAW - VirtualBox, Vagrant, git, ansible. https://github.com/rtilla1/claw-playbook/blob/patch-1/forBeginners.md
  - Cara Key's XML to CSV tool is something we'll probably be recommending folks use to tidy their metatdata before migration. This will probably be an alternate migration path than pulling directly from a Fedora. https://github.com/rtilla1/claw-playbook/blob/patch-1/forBeginners.md
  - The ticket about the XML2CSV is here: https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/CLAW/issues/898 
  - Note for those running Claw Playbook: to do a full clean re-do of your Vagrant box (if there have been changes to ansible roles, and this is alpha so it probably is:
    - first vagrant destroy
    - then delete the roles/external folder
    - then git pull the new code in claw-playbook
    - then `vagrant up`.
  - Authorities are now taxonomy terms. "Controlled Access Terms" is the module that sets this up. There is a demo module within Controlled Access Terms that creates some vocabularies (Structure > Taxonomy) with fields so that you can make terms representing People, Organizations, etc. https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/controlled_access_terms 
    - Therefore, "nodes" are the objects you're representing; "taxonomy terms" are objects you need to make linked metadata.
  - Seth Shaw created a "preliminary" metadata profile based on our mapping, but also including other areas we haven't got to yet, like Subject. This pull request was merged during the call. This default, out of the box (islandora_demo) metadata profile is therefore provisional, not in any way definitive, and does not represent the final decisions of the MIG! They just needed a place to put stuff. https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/islandora_demo/commit/0936ff4175a3ecc91d682a13604bab7a22d1d669
  - We will demonstrate what this looks like with some example metadata, as it appears in RDF in Drupal, Fedora, and the Triplestore, as it seems we will be supporting (to some extent) the use of Fedora as an open endpoint and therefore a coherent source of the RDF graph describing our collection.
  -

2. Discussion of originInfo
  - We decided to only look at Dates right now. Publisher, Place, etc. will be discussed next meeting.
  - We decided that the different dates should be treated differently, and not merged into the same field (in the simple mapping).
  - Most date subfields in MODS have now been mapped to their equivalents in DC Terms. The only one we didn't officially decide today was dateCaptured, because we believe it refers to the digital event (of snapshotting or digitization) and therefore is not metadata about the "Thing" (used loosely, read Manifestation) being described. 
    - dateIssued --> dcterms:issued
    - dateCreated --> dcterms:created
    - dateValid --> dcterms:valid
    - dateModified --> dcterms:modified
    - copyrightDate --> dcterms:dateCopyrighted
  - We have said we'd look into PREMIS as a source of dateCaptured.
  - We will accept anything in the CLAW date fields - but we wish to support the kinds of partial, qualified, uncertain dates, and date ranges that exist in EDTF. (note: EDTF is the Extended Date Time Format, an extension to the ISO standard 8601, illustrated in the RDA toolkit and on Duke's Digital repository documentation. We don't have the features yet, but we would like dates formatted in good EDTF to be sortable, filterable, and displayed "nicely" to the user.

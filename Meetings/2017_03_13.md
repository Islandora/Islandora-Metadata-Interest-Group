  * Interesting points include building their repository on FAIR principles for data sharing, for which the Autocomplete allows enriched metadata. Their infrastructure is not Islandora-based, but because they used a Drupal front-end they can plug in the XML forms module with their enhancement for better description of their data.  Their lookup connects to APIs from the likes of EBI's Ontology Lookup Service.  
  * Paul demonstrated the lookup and the metadata which the process created.  This allows for a cool faceted search feature on their site.

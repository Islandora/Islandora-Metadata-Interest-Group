* Continue Mapping of highlighted fields in [Simplified Mapping Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18u2qFJ014IIxlVpM3JXfDEFccwBZcoFsjbBGpvL0jJI/edit#gid=0)
  * Discuss goals: Location, Record Info, and Part
  * When attempting to draft mappings for these fields, the Co-Convener group frequently found that we were okay with certain fields
  being left simple in this initial mapping, but that we are hoping for more explicit direction in a Metadata Application Profile. 
  We'd like input from the group on this idea taking the place of some of the options in holdingSimple, holdingExternal, shelfLocator,
  and relatedItem. Specifically, rather than mapping data from these fields, creating a standard that says data about who owns a 
  collection and where it is located (including collection URLs, Finding Aids of parent archival collections, OCLC symbols, etc.) 
  should be mapped to particular fields (without having expectations about which fields it is coming from (because many of us put them in different locations in MODS).
  * Problem example arose:
  ```
  <mods>
    <titleInfo>
      <title>Anne Goes To School</title>
    </titleInfo>
    <relatedItem type=“host”>
      <titleInfo><title>Anne of Green Gables<title></titleInfo>
      <part>Chapter 1</part>
    </relatedItem>
  </mods>
 *
 
  * Optional solution: rework your metadata to include <part>Chapter 1</part> as <partName> within the title of the primary object,
  and only describe its relationship to the host (not to parts of the host).
  * Optional solution: We create a different mapping for relatedItem part than for MODS part?

### Next meeting:

1. Lingering OriginInfo (Co-conveners located these options for discussion):
    * mods/originInfo eventType="" attribute will be ignored in simple mapping.
    * mods/originInfo/frequency map to rdau:frequency
    * mods/originInfo/issuance map to rdau:modeOfIssuance
    * mods/originInfo/place map to relators:pup (ie. place of publication, with a literal or URI allowed)
  
1. Geographic Subjects (mods/subject/geographic and mods/subject/cartographic)
  * Samvera example uses these examples:
  
     * [simple geographic subject from an authority](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#heading=h.mtxmmdrna1sf)
     * [simple geographic subject with string value](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#heading=h.d43qs875r43w)
     * [geographic subject with minted uri for authority value](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#heading=h.rewzadxvxku)
     * [geographic subject with minted uri for string](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#heading=h.m6yow0r9rp7s)

### Notes:

1. Announcements
   * South Central States Fedora Users Group meeting: January 16-17, 2019 at UT-Austin-more information [here](https://wiki.duraspace.org/x/GIY7Bg)

1. Question for MIG from a Github Issue (Mark Jordan)
   * FOXML use case import issue: https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/CLAW/issues/959 
   - Do we need to provide all versions of MODS? 
   - Will people need to access old versions of MODS?
   - We suspect that previous versions being incorporated as binaries attached to the same object would meet most needs, but if anyone is using Islandora as a Trusted Digital Repository or is beholden to other external standards around keeping old metadata, they may have a requirement to keep the old metadata. We think the IR group may need to be consulted because they'd be the group that may have those requirements.
   - Related code Mark Jordan is work on: https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_whole_object
   
1. EDTF Widget
    * Rosie's Documentation about the EDTF widget: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12TqQ1IvBQDBRd2CPTpYbHep7KV6SKcOUqVJEtFt_SGg/edit#heading=h.jgfhcn3wpw2m
    * Please experiment with the widget and feel free to contribute to the documentation and we will try to get this into shape for official CLAW documentation.

1. Lingering OriginInfo (Co-conveners located these options for discussion):
    * mods/originInfo eventType="" attribute will be ignored in simple mapping.
    * mods/originInfo/frequency map to rdau:frequency
    * mods/originInfo/issuance map to rdau:modeOfIssuance
    * mods/originInfo/place map to relators:pup (ie. place of publication)
       -Proposed solution: If code=marccountry, will be assigned taxonomy term. If other code = add them to the taxonomy term list. If text or no type (or fails?), will be treated as literal.

### Next meetings:

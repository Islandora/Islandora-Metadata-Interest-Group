#### Agenda:

#### Notes and Questions:
* Take-aways from CLAW meeting:
  * Good timing as our understanding grows
  * Feedback helped us think differently about string data vs. locally minted identifiers
  * Programmatically it's more possible to always use identifiers and to later group them together than to sort out strings instead of URIs
  * Apache service will allow us to mesh identifiers later; essentially a database for managing the identifiers
  * We are better off using something like dcterms:creator and having a mess of URIs for uncontrolled names and using the Apache service to fit them together later.
* Review Simon Fraser files with extension elements (mostly Cdm technical data):
  * Questions raised: How is technical metadata going to be migrated from Islandora 7.x to CLAW? Will there be a way to pull data from MODS extension elements and FOXML technical files in Islandora during the migration? Or will the Cdm data end up just being left behind?
* Migrations Discussion:
 * Migrations "go a lot smoother if metadata mapping can be a little loose."
 * Many members of the group mentioned migrations that take 5+ years and that migrations can make it difficult to keep up with updates.
#### Homework: 
* Next meeting (Nov 27): take a look at your institutions [mods:note](https://trello.com/c/BDRishWv) and come ready to discuss.

### Notes:
* Rosie shared their review of the changes we'd like to see made to Islandora Defaults based on our previous discussions.
  * 3-4 bullet points to come (still seeking clarity)
  * No string conceptual model of what objects are media nodes.
  * Use Case:  If you have a real world object and a file that represents that object (tif of newspaper page, or photo of statue), that would go onto media, so a real world object would go on the node. We like the ability of FITS and want to extract metadata out, however we want to do that for more than one file. This information is inherent in the file itself. It’s important to have, and normally see that as information people shouldn’t edit.
  * Are looking into making it so it’s hard to edit, however, there are some things where we want to include technical metadata that is not included (creation of file, etc). Things are buried in XML files. We want to automatically extract that information and put it into fields like media so it’s easier to enact preservation policies.
  * Changes we want to see in islandora defaults : if we make FITs, could we attach that to the file that it’s about? So it’s more localized, and can have FITS about more than one file on your node -- making use of multi file media paradigm. 
Would like to automatically extract things on fields on the media  
  * Admin permissions in relationship to these views? Last conversation said only admins can see the media section in those forums. And some metadata people aren’t admins.
  * We'll leave the file available for comments and questions for a few weeks.

### Next Meeting:
* November 16, 2020
* Topics: In future - Open discussion about communication and figure out what we want to prioritize. Think of examples of good and not so good communication and collaboration experiences for next discussion.

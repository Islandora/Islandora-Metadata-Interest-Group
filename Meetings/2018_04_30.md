#### Agenda:
##### Welcome and Announcements
##### Rosie provided a link to the [“Samvera MODS to RDF Working Group: MODS to RDF Mapping Recommendations”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ffCyIirUkESLefBehafbacsLb_Rq7KJbTxxeoQCyLpw/edit?usp=sharing)
##### Comparing [Title in Samvera](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ffCyIirUkESLefBehafbacsLb_Rq7KJbTxxeoQCyLpw/edit#heading=h.8ru7tly8q58) to the mappings recorded in our [mods:title card on Trello](https://trello.com/c/DHFwghqW/49-modstitle)
 * Their simplest mapping requires 3 RDF options, and we don't know if that's simple enough for our simple form, but DCterms title could be our title option on our simple form.
 * We do have supplied titles, but we don't know if it's recorded in the supplied attribute and we don't (as a group) feel like it's very important to carry over that data.
    * We could create a mapping that finds the attribute supplied="yes" or a particular 24x in MARC and transforms it (to a dcterms:title with the "[Title in brackets]" like Samvera) or keep the title as is and add a note field "Title supplied by cataloger." We won't strike out punctuation that exists.
 * We will copy page 9, example 3 for language tags if there are parallel titles.
 * For immediate mapping, most of us won't need example 4, but we will leave it as an option in the complicated form.
 * Example 5 is not a situation we expect to have. Anytime there is an alternative title, we'll put that content into dcterms:alternative, regardless of whether it has other attributes.
 * If anyone has Uniform titles, we'll include the string in <mods:title> to dcterms:title and the valueURI into dce:title.
      * This raises the issue of how to handle external URIs, which we are still working on.
 * Alternative titles will be handled the same (see example 7) whether they are in a transliterated text or a non-unicode text. Danny is going to look into how Drupal handles unicode. The language in @lang after the title, and all titles in dcterms:alternative.
##### [Minted Object Titles in Samvera](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ffCyIirUkESLefBehafbacsLb_Rq7KJbTxxeoQCyLpw/edit#heading=h.1hy1qeuvkvad)
* We may need the complex options for minted object mappings, for the following use cases:
   1. Subtitle split out from title
   2. Sort titles/non-sort characters
   3. Part name and number
   4. Smoothing out the distinctions when mixing and matching complex and simple titles

#### Post-meeting review of decisions:
1. For the most basic titles, the only title information in a simple mapping would be dcTitle.
1. Language handled with @ tags. Example:
2. dcTitle for most titles, including Uniform Titles with URIs. Examples:
3. dcterms:alternative for alternative titles, regardless if supplied, translated, or transcribed. Examples:
4. Information about who supplied titles, where on an object a title was included, etc. will be included in notes fields, as per current RDA.

#### For next time:
 * We will continue discussing what parts of [Samvera mappings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ffCyIirUkESLefBehafbacsLb_Rq7KJbTxxeoQCyLpw/edit#) and [Bibframe VariantTitle](http://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe.html#c_VariantTitle) we can use to address the use cases described on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/c/8dR1jq1c/62-modstitle)

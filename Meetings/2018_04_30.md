#### Agenda:
* Welcome and Announcements
* Rosie provided a link to the “Samvera MODS to RDF Working Group: MODS to RDF Mapping Recommendations” -- 
    * https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ffCyIirUkESLefBehafbacsLb_Rq7KJbTxxeoQCyLpw/edit?usp=sharing
* Review the Samvera MODS to RDF Working Group: MODS to RDF Mapping Recommendations, particularly the introductory background information and the mappings we’ve reviewed (mods:title & mods:name)  -- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ffCyIirUkESLefBehafbacsLb_Rq7KJbTxxeoQCyLpw/edit?usp=sharing 

     * Began with [Title in Samvera](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ffCyIirUkESLefBehafbacsLb_Rq7KJbTxxeoQCyLpw/edit#heading=h.8ru7tly8q58) comparing the mappings to our needs recorded in our [mods:title card on Trello](https://trello.com/c/DHFwghqW/49-modstitle)
      * Their simplest mapping requires 3 RDF options, and we don't know if that's simple enough for our simple form.
      * DCterms title could be our title option on our simple form
      * Do we have supplied titles? Yes, but we don't know if it's recorded in an attribute. 
      * We could create a mapping that finds the attribute supplied="yes" or a particular 24x in MARC and transforms it (to a dcterms:title with the "[Title in brackets]" like Samvera) or keep the title as is and add a note field "Title supplied by cataloger." We won't strike out punctuation that exists.

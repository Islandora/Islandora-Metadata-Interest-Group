13:03:01	 From Rachel Tillay : https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/islandora_demo/pull/2

13:13:29	 From Rachel Tillay : dcterms:accrualPeriodicity
13:14:00	 From Rachel Tillay : http://dublincore.org/documents/2012/06/14/dcmi-terms/#terms-accrualPeriodicity
13:14:38	 From Daniel Lamb  : seems like it's just for collections?
13:25:01	 From Rosie : http://bibliontology.com/
13:27:28	 From Daniel Lamb  : https://www.coar-repositories.org/activities/repository-interoperability/coar-vocabularies/
13:27:33	 From Rachel Tillay : http://id.loc.gov/search/?q=&q=cs%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fid.loc.gov%2Fvocabulary%2Ffrequencies
13:27:48	 From Rosie : ooh Rachel! That looks promising
13:30:54	 From jradding : Just for what it's worth, here is theSmavera MODS to RDF groups direct mapping for Origin info, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#They use rdau:frequency.en for the predicate with the LOC Publication Frequencies Scheme linked above.
13:32:14	 From jradding : Meant for that to link directly to originInfo: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FZI8KJiW4qSKYUUKe0mAwqlx0ppVRFyPtsfLDqQE5T8/edit#heading=h.11yqlw12myf8
13:33:32	 From michaelbolam : http://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/u/#
13:34:39	 From jradding : They map it to the LOC controlled vocabulary. 
13:36:49	 From Daniel Lamb  : sounds like it to me
13:38:32	 From Rachel Tillay : Example curie (canonical)*: 	rdau:P60001Example curie (lexical)*: 	rdau:respondentOf
13:39:03	 From Daniel Lamb  : http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/u/P60001
13:42:33	 From Daniel Lamb  : I've got to step out here, folks
13:42:37	 From Daniel Lamb  : sry
13:42:41	 From Daniel Lamb  : c u in two weeks
13:43:38	 From Rosie : cya Danny
13:43:39	 From jradding : They can have corporate nafs
13:43:57	 From Rosie : reconciliation / data cleaning could be tedious.
13:47:13	 From jradding : At Amherst we are treating publisher as an agent and have currently decided to do that in MODS by putting publisher in a name element with roleTerm:publisher so our plan for RDF is to do the same and use relator:pbl
13:47:51	 From Rosie : ok cool. @jradding do you also use authority control on publishers?
13:48:44	 From jradding : We do use the corporate NAF. If a publisher doesn't have one, we are NACO trained and through our NACO funnel wil create an NAF
13:48:55	 From Rosie : cool!
13:49:27	 From michaelbolam : Yeah. That makes a lot of sense to me.
13:50:04	 From jradding : We are trying to do this with a lot of our agents in our digitized collections in anticipation of eventually moving to a linked data system/RDF and creating NAFs where possible instead of using local authorities.
13:50:48	 From jradding : Obviously not all names will warrant an NAF so it's not 100% but is being done when/where possible.
13:51:49	 From Rachel Tillay : premis:captured https://www.google.com/url?q=http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/preservation/eventType/cap.html&sa=D&ust=1538416911548000&usg=AFQjCNENfRxaq-6ge90ZKdbHkkQwhtG5sw

13:53:57	 From Rosie : oh yeah you’re right this is it
13:55:02	 From Melissa Anez : Just FYI, another group has the IF’s Zoom room booked right after this, so we’ll need it at the hour
13:55:22	 From Melissa Anez : thanks!
13:56:37	 From Rachel Tillay : Great!
13:56:42	 From Rachel Tillay : My mic is still in and out.
13:57:10	 From Rachel Tillay : So, next meeting we'll review the rdau options, and then move on to place of publication and geographic subject!
13:57:25	 From Rachel Tillay : See y'all then!
13:57:37	 From morfitpb : THank you!

### Notes: 
* Announcements
   * Starter Site
      * Rosie sent updates to the Islandora List-serv on [January 13th](https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/islandora/204a5746-c8f6-477b-aec3-c03af02c86c8n%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer) and [January 23rd](https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/islandora/55922c40-d6d4-4986-8860-4bc7dfa00666n%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer)
      * Currently work is being done on the site, prepping it for the Islandora Camp in March
      * You can read more and ask questions on the Islandora Slack channel "starter_dev"
   * MIG "Where are you at" Survey
      * Survey went out at the beginning of the month to the Islandora List-serv. If you didn't get the email you can visit [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiAyRZ4j5tLC86rSWITDZJnOa6WTTKUuNuaVA2x-IA1F6u5g/viewform?usp=sf_link) to visit us directly. We hope to use the responses to guide future MIG agendas.
   * Dani announced that PALS launched their first Islandora 2 site last week, with a second going live next week.
* Field Of The Week: Language
   * See link above for discussion points. For other points discussed by the group in response:
   * What is missing?
   * Are we using it for Term or for Code? What is the community doing?
      * Use primarily as language of resource, not langauage of cataloging
      * Michael says UPITT records the code, so that the value can be more reusable in other databases
      * Devon says UTX is using iso 639-bc instead of 639-2 and recording term and code both
      * Chris mentioned possibility of adding code as metadata in the vocabulary
   * If all or most of the objects in a collection are in English, do you not add a language value in each record? Only record non-English values?
      * Michael: If data is being reused elsewhere then you want to have the language value recorded, not assumed (DPLA, LOC, etc.)
      * Devon: not possible because of the variety of languages in the collection. They have had to create codes for some indigenous languages.
      * UTX has started working with translating subject headings into Spanish and Portugeuse
   * Is there anything with Islandora Modern that you'd like it to do with Language?
      * Devon mentioned pre-loading iso 639-3 by default
   * Brief discussion of the Drupal Language field, separate and used with site translation
   * Has anyone had experience with non-latin characters?
      * Yes in I7. UPITT has a great number of collections of Japanese and Chinese objects
   * Are people including translations of abstracts or descriptions in both english and other language
      * UTX Subjects in both English and Spanish for examples see collaboration with UFL [https://guides.uflib.ufl.edu/pana/overview](https://guides.uflib.ufl.edu/pana/overview)
   * I8 says it is based off MARC Language Code, but which is that?
      * https://www.loc.gov/marc/languages/language_name.html
      * https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
      * Other?
   * Use the english term for a language? Or the native term for the language?
      * UTX using the original language term for many Indigenous languages
*  Open Discussion
   * Harriet brought up a request/desire for professional development opportunities that focused on the metadata side, practical instruction
   * [IslandoraCamp](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora-community/wiki/IslandoraCamp-2023) is coming up March 20-21 (virtual) and is often an opportunity for more hands-on sessions
   * What type of sessions would be of use with this type of focus?
      * Intro to the interface from a Metadata perspective
      * Migration Focus
      * Deep Dive like how Term of the Week has gone
      * Connecting MODS (I7) to Modern Islandora Metadata Fields
   * The idea of returning to old "field of the week" sessions was discussed. Revisiting terms with the knowledge we've gained doing the process to this point. Better context?

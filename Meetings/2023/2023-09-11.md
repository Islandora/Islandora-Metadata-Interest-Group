### Agenda: 
* Announcements
* DLF Metadata Assessment Tools (Chris)
* Open Conversation as time allows


### Notes: 
* DLF Metadata Assessment Tools
   * Chris shared on slack a few weeks ago a message about DLF 
   * This is a group from the Digital Library Federation, and it could be of use to people who work with metadata. 
   * Subgroups include, Tools, Website, Benchmark (putting together resources related to establishing metadata benchmark assessment), documentation and Social Media (working on sharing materials people are putting together). 
   * Tools group: have been working to bring various tools together that are used for metadata assessment and creation. The last year, they've worked to make it a searchable form. Updated DLF AIG MWG Tools Repository : 
     * [[link to blog post]](https://www.diglib.org/updated-dlf-aig-mwg-tools-repository/)
     * [[the link to resources itself]](https://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io/projects/tools/)
     * [other resources you can find put together by Metadata assessment group](https://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io/projects/)
   	* [Metadata Application Profiles (MAPS)](https://dlfmetadataassessment.github.io/projects/metadata-application-profiles/) 
   		* MAPS also has an open submission form 
   * Another thing to point out, in the past they've done workshops at DLF conferences on metadata assessment. 
   * The DLF is open to anyone to join -- slight change from years before. They are currently on the wind-down cycle of the year. November/December they become more quiet, and spin back up January/February/March. 
   * Questions? Feel free to ask Chris or Mike 
* Last week catch up: 
	* Questions about last week: renaming Linked Agend label: 
		* Update-- Rosie up in pull request, and it has been merged! Now we just need to update documentation. 
	* Question about Chris's talk about Institutional Repository and Metadata: 
		* Next step, sharing with IR interest group -- this is a conversation started on what can be sharable in the community. 
* Open Conversation: 
	* Workflow question: We are taking Metadata sheets out of Islandora 7, making changes, and using worksheet to ingest back into Islandora, however, dates get reformatted specifically when moving from CSV to Excel (date get formatted to Excel-specific coding)
	* Suggested: Data comes out in CSV. If people work in Excel right off, you can open Excel and import data.
		* depending on version: Data -> Get Data -> From File -> From Text/CSV
	* Libreoffice is a good place to use. However, importing data instead of opening the file right off with excel should help (when you do this, change settings to "type text" not "general". This also helps with strings of numbers (like identifiers) from being turned into scientific numbers. 
	* Excel 365 does strange things where it corrupts data. 
	* Another suggestion: before you make changes, add in encoding to end of date (adding |edtf|" to end of the date. That way when you edit in excel, the date's wont change when people edit. And before you ingest via workbench, batch control and remove the encoding. 

* Next meeting: falls on Jewish holiday (September 25th). Should we meet then, or skip and have our next meeting on October 9th? Co-conveners will converse and discuss.
* Open meeting is September 26th where MIG is just giving an update on what we've been doing/using it as a recruitment opportunity. 

* *Remember!* We are always interested in hearing what people are interested in, if there is something of interest that you are working on, if there is interest in migrations, or cleaning metadata, or other aspects, feel free to bring them to us for conversation!  Feel free to reach out to Chris, Paige or Rosie, or mention in the slack channel! 

### Next meeting:

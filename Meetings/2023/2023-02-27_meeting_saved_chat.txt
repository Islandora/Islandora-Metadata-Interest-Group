10:14:10 From  Paige Morfitt (she/her)  to  Everyone:
	my fault! Sorry!
10:22:31 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:
	only in one specific collection, bc we're slowly restoring the items (all are born-digital). I believe we may do that for born-digi items in the future but not for analog materials. that technical scanning metadata is stored in separate spreadsheets using diff schemas. that info + descriptive metadata is then written to tape together for long-term preservation.
10:23:49 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:
	it's mostly for access purposes, just letting ppl know the items were made in an outdated piece of software, they'll have to come in person to see it, etc. etc.
10:23:58 From  Ross, Staci L  to  Everyone:
	digitalOrigin defs follow (sorry for the bad paste :/): born digital – A resource was created in digital form and is intended to remain in digital form.	    reformatted digital – A resource that was created by digitizing an original analog resource.	    digitized microfilm – A resource that was created by digitizing a microform.	    digitized other analog – A resource that was created by digitizing a non-original, second-generation type analog resource, such as a photocopy.

	I’d like to see a “tactile material >> moon"

	Same here! Turns out it's a type of embossed language for visually impaired users: https://origin-archive.ifla.org/IV/ifla65/65jg1-e.htm

	I'm only a little disappointed they didn't mean an actual hand-held moon 😊
10:34:23 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:
	from the few born-digi guidelines I've seen for EAD, yes, extent is used for file size. MG, GB etc, it would make sense to do that here
10:34:39 From  Devon Murphy (they/them)  to  Everyone:

10:38:14 From  Rosie Le Faive (she/they)  to  Everyone:
	(but we could pre-load the starter site, if you want, let me know)
10:51:24 From  Paige Morfitt (she/her)  to  Everyone:
	makes me thing, if you use the form what happens if two people are working on the same object at the same time? Does an alert or error appear?
10:51:54 From  Chris Day  to  Everyone:
	I7 had a module that would lock objects so only one person could edit at at time. Not default but you had add it.
10:55:21 From  Ross, Staci L  to  Everyone:
	Hm, good question, Paige. I'm not sure we've experienced that, yet, but there have been issues with getting updates to save for single users
10:55:32 From  Ross, Staci L  to  Everyone:
	ack, that's for I7 :)

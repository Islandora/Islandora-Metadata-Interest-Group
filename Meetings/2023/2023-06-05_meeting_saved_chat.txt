12:39:12 From Staci Ross to Everyone:
	RDA, DACs, etc. are moving toward using the term "agent" instead of "names"
12:40:29 From Seth Shaw to Everyone:
	Actually, "agent" may have been an EAD thing....
12:42:47 From Seth Shaw to Everyone:
	NM, agent wasn't introduced in EAD until EAD 3.

	Seuss, Dr.
12:56:15 From Staci Ross to Everyone:
	May not be relevant, but you should also be careful with pseudonyms. In LCNAF, these have separate name authorities (i.e., Sam Clemens vs. Mark Twain)
12:57:38 From Bolam, Michael R to Everyone:
	Gotta run to another meeting. See you all in a couple weeks.
12:58:13 From Elisa Naquin to Everyone:
	Thanks, everyone

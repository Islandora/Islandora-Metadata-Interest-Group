      * Website(https://2023.islandora.ca)
      * Call for Proposals ~~May 1~~ Deadline extended to May 8 after meeting
      * Register Now(https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/553699408837)
   * From Previous Meeting: "Purging Data From A Field, in order to change that field"
      * This should work. You can purge data with Views, but caution is encouraged.
* Field(s) Of The Week: Dates! (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rk0o_0byzeHrSKst0Feval_QeVZmo2DeIP0Mk3jaaFc/edit#heading=h.id38mzpymtm5)
   * All Date fields in the starter site have the same out of the box settings. 
   * All are EDTF Fields.
      * Extended Date/Time Format(https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/)
      * EDTF Display is handled by the EDTF Default Formatter found in Metadata Display
   * Seasons
      * See section "Level 1" on the main EDTF page: Seasons (Staci)
      * The values 21, 22, 23, 24 may be used used to signify ' Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn', 'Winter', respectively, in place of a month value (01 through 12) for a year-and-month format string. (Staci)
      * And to confuse things, under Level 2 you can signify 'summer in the northern hemisphere' vs 'summer in the southern hemisphere (Rosie)
   * Ingest
      * Workbench: Dates have to be in EDTF Formatting or you will get an error
      * Also when using metadata form, will reject incorrectly formatted dates
   * SOLR and Searching
      * Stored as SOLR Stings not SOLR Dates
      * On the wish list to index properly (Seth)
      * No "Keydate" field, so no "single date" sort unless you create one or require one of the date fields
      * Sorting with uncertain or approximate can give strange results
   * Free Text Date Field
      * Might be needed to supplement EDTF formatted fields to allow for more types of date description
      * Examples centuries or eras
      * Or if you don't want to transform your date values to EDTF
      * Would need to build yourself; no field currently in Starter Site
   * Gregorian and Julian calendar focused
      * Other systems may not translate properly in EDTF
   * Questions
      * Has any one locally implemented a free-text display? (Staci) 
         * Whitman College has. Was easier to have a human readable for students to parse the value (Paige)
      * Seth: Drupal does have "Date" fields that may not give you everything EDTF does, but may work more into Drupal functionality for sorting, etc. than EDTF
      * Created a unique field to work with Archivespace for "Date Expression" (Seth)
         * Part of Archivespace Module
         * https://git.drupalcode.org/project/archivesspace/-/blob/8.x-1.x/src/Plugin/Field/FieldType/ASDate.php(https://git.drupalcode.org/project/archivesspace/-/blob/8.x-1.x/src/Plugin/Field/FieldType/ASDate.php)
         * https://git.drupalcode.org/project/archivesspace/-/blob/8.x-1.x/src/Plugin/Field/FieldFormatter/ASDateFormatter.php(https://git.drupalcode.org/project/archivesspace/-/blob/8.x-1.x/src/Plugin/Field/FieldFormatter/ASDateFormatter.php)
      * Faceting On Dates (Rosie)
         * Can Facet by Year.
         * Go into SOLR index and turn of function "value by year"
         * Chose the fields you want to index like this
         * Then you can have a Facet that shows up the "Year"
         * Can also use a date Slider with this functionality (which Seth says is much more stable recently)
         * Will also index all dates in a Date Range, which can present a lot of values
* Open Conversation
   * Dani: Has anyone used authority link out to LC
      * Authority Link module by Alexander O'Neil [add link]
      * Is there a need for a New type of field which pulls in the Value and the Value URI
      * Not saved as a Taxonomy, not linked to the same value in other records
      * Rosie: Don't really have a field out of the box that allows you to add "Name As On Item" and link to the authority
      * Seth: UNLV had played with a widget that combined taxonomy and authority link look-up, but didn't get it working before developers moved on
      * Staci: We've locally applied a "statement of responsibility" field to capture data as printed on the object (but it's only used for metadata from MARC for now)
      * Paige: We add "statement of responsibility" to description or notes
   * Rosie: The way that EDTF terms are displayed can be edited, but it is hardcoded
   * Seth semantic difference between 1984/.. and 1984/ former is "end unknown" the later is "ongoing"
      * The formatter display does not distinguish between the two
   * Mike: A date range can mean between two dates, inclusive; or it can mean an unknown date between these two dates

10:16:33 From Ross, Staci L To Everyone:
	To follow up to Mike's question, how are folks providing linked agent headings for conference and title names?

10:19:22 From Paige Morfitt To Dani Kroon(Privately):

	Thank you!
10:19:58 From Rosie Le Faive (she/they) To Everyone:
	Replying to "@Ross, Staci L incon..."
	
	We haven‚Äôt let anyone ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù add anything yet, but I imagine having some in the wrong taxonomy will be likely in the future
10:20:35 From Ross, Staci L To Everyone:
	I believe someone (maybe Mike) mentioned that taxonomies can get unwieldy with too many terms, so that might be a good reason to distinguish for management (and retrieval?) purpose?
10:26:00 From Ross, Staci L To Everyone:
	Makes sense. Thanks, Chris and all! :)
10:28:44 From Ross, Staci L To Everyone:
	I believe Rosie mentioned what may be a good reason why they were split: different name types have different requirements (birth vs. establishment dates, mergers of corporate bodies/conferences, etc.) It may be important to maintain that in the future, but we definitely have bigger tofu fish to fry :)
10:29:27 From Elisabeth Ball, FLVC To Everyone:
	Reacted to "I believe Rosie ment..." with üëç
10:29:33 From Rosie Le Faive (she/they) To Everyone:

	lol, I thought so! :D
10:30:47 From Paige Morfitt To Everyone:
	Now I'm trying to figure out which restaurant had tofu fish, lol.

	Right? I'm intrigued...

	Zenith!
10:31:24 From Bolam, Michael R To Everyone:
	Replying to "Now I'm trying to fi..."
	
	It is just a block of tofu with some breading, to be honest.
10:31:31 From Ross, Staci L To Everyone:
	Reacted to "It is just a block o..." with üòÜ
10:31:32 From Bolam, Michael R To Everyone:

12:08:00 From Ross, Staci L To Everyone:
	Agents makes a lot of sense here, though it may not be intuitive to folks outside the metadata community
12:10:28 From Paige Morfitt To Everyone:
	That's what I was thinking. I wasn't sure if Creator and Contributor would be two different fields.
12:14:48 From Ross, Staci L To Everyone:
	+1 Seth! It's tough to strike the balance between those of us in the metadata/Islandora/Drupal communities with those of users outside the library community. "Agents" is pretty jargon, but familiar to the former side, in my opinion
12:15:11 From Paige Morfitt To Everyone:
	Throwing it out, MARC has 7xx Added Entry Personal/Corporate/Meeting name. Not ideal, but I was curious.
12:18:07 From Seth Shaw To Everyone:
	Perhaps "Contributing Agents"?
12:18:23 From Harriet South To Everyone:
	Reacted to "Perhaps "Contributin..." with üëç
12:18:25 From Ross, Staci L To Everyone:
	Reacted to "Perhaps "Contributin..." with üëç

12:19:58 From Paige Morfitt To Everyone:
	Creators, and Co-creators?
12:24:20 From Ross, Staci L To Everyone:
	The field would display something like: Contributors:
	Le Faive, Rosie, creator
	Day, Chris, contributor
	South, Harriet, writer of supplementary content
	... etc.
12:24:48 From Ross, Staci L To Everyone:
	(if you include roles in the data)
12:24:54 From Rosie Le Faive (she/they) To Everyone:
	Yes, though the formatting at the moment is 
	Creator: Le Faive, Rosie
	Contributor: Day, Chris etc
12:25:11 From Ross, Staci L To Everyone:
	Replying to "Yes, though the form..."
	
	Very cool! That's even better!
12:29:13 From Paige Morfitt To Everyone:
	What about "Agent" as profession? Would the field be Agent: Agent: Juan, Don?
12:30:46 From Bolam, Michael R To Everyone:
	Replying to "What about "Agent" a..."
	
	What about adding the metal band Kreator as creator if we call it creator? 
	
	Creator: Creator: Kreator?!?!
12:31:19 From Paige Morfitt To Everyone:
	Replying to "What about "Agent" a..."

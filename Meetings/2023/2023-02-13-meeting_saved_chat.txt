	yes -- that's why we didn't go w/ paragraphs for notes (but we then didn't go with them for the rest of the form, for different complicated reasons lol)

	yes, we abandoned them bc of not being able to use/structure RDF, and bc it made the form we were trying to build too complex for our developers.

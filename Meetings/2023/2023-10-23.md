* Open Conversation as time allows


### Notes: 
* Announcements
 * Rosie made an announcement of the Wishlist discussion that we planned for later in the meeting. A discussion of metadata focused features, updates, or changes to Islandora Starter Site that we might have. Participants were encouraged to start thinking for future conversation.
 * Elisabeth Ball from Florida Virtual Campus introduced herself and said that she and other colleagues from the FLVC were going to start attending meetings as they work on learning all they can about Islandora. The group welcomes them.
* Demo: "How to Export & Manipulate Name Data from your Islandora Site" (Rosie LeFaive)
 * This demonstration was recorded. It can be viewed on YouTube on the [Islandora Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/@islandorafoundation9224)'s channel in the new [Metadata In Islandora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzmOclWR85k&list=PL4seFC7ELUtoMvodT0vKYvzJUzdpyFzaK) playlist. Direct link is [https://youtu.be/qzmOclWR85k?si=imtwMRVO8DMDMac-](https://youtu.be/qzmOclWR85k?si=imtwMRVO8DMDMac-)
 * The following are selected notes on the demonstration. For full step-by-step it is recommended that you view the recording.
 * The demonstration focused on the Persons taxonomy in a collection of 488 books.
 * The Persons taxonomy can be viewed by going to Structure > Taxonomy > and selecting the Persons taxonomy from the list
 * There is no built in action to export a Taxonomy as a CSV so we will build one using Views
  * Note: The [Taxonomy Manager](https://www.drupal.org/project/taxonomy_manager) module, which is included in the Starter Site, is a quick qay to edit terms in a Taxonomy, but its export feature is limited. It only exports the Terms themselves; no metadata fields from within the Taxonomy and no Term ID (which is important for exporting & reimporting using something like Workbench)
 * Views can be accessed by going to Structure > Views
 * Add A View
  * The demonstration is to add a view titled "Views Export"
  * It is recommended that you add a description, for clarity sake.
  * View Settings: Show "Taxonomy Terms" of type "Person"
  * Page Settings: Create a Page
   * This will let you create place to go and see a human readable version of this view and its content
  * Views Interface
   * Add Sort Criteria: Name (taxonomy term)
   * Sort Order: Ascending or Descending
 * Edit View Page
  * Add Fields: Term ID [the TID of a taxonomy term, like Node ID)
 * Save View (to keep your changes)
 * Displays > Add > Data Export
  * Allows you to export csv, json, xml, jsonid, etc.
  * Page settings: path : names-export-csv [for web page]
  * Filename: names-export.csv [for export]
  * Store file in public files directory
  * Download immediately
  * Attach to: page
 * Export Settings
  * Export Method: batch (choose when working with large groups of data, can choose batch size)
  * Limit: no limit [that way it will get all without breaking into pages]
 * Can easily change the Views Setting to another taxonomy to reuse this with new criteria
 * Uses for view
  * Easiest "change" is making corrections
  * Deleting or combine terms would need separate csv for import based on action
  * More advanced view could show amount of use for term ???
 * Notes:
  * Terms with HTML entities (like ampersand) will be exported as HTML, but workbench can not import those, so they will have to be updated in csv before reimport
  * Module: [Taxonomy Manager](https://www.drupal.org/project/taxonomy_manager)
  * Module: [Views Data Export](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_data_export)

* Preparing For Migration
 * Paige and Chris discussed different methods of exporting metadata from I7 for different paths to migration.
 * Chris talked about the FOXML migration path, used by DiscoveryGarden and shared [here](https://github.com/discoverygarden/foxml)
  * FOXML migrates from the original FOXML objects in I7, so metadata is coming straight from the MODS datastream
  * But important to examine the metadata to get a true picture of the metadata fields and values being used
  * Things like hidden fields, orphan fields, needed transformations (there is an XSLT step in the FOXML migration that allows for the normalization of the MODS xml for better mapping)
  * Server level access is needed, so in Chris' workflow one of the DG developers runs a script to query the resource index and request the download of the datastreams
  * Other tools include the [Islandora Datastream CRUD](https://github.com/SFULibrary/islandora_datastream_crud) module which allows you to download MODS datastreams by PID, by Collection, by Content Type, or by SQL Query.
 * Paige's process was extraordinarily messy: most metadata was still in spreadsheets, had done a recent migration from bepress; so asked various groups for most recent spreadsheets
  * She created a master spreadsheet with all fields from various spreadsheets to see which fields were used in which collections
  * She then had to identify which collections did not have a spreadsheet and what fields are used for those
  * This involved manually downloaded datastreams one at a time to verify which fields are being used
  * Used OXYGEN to strip out all but mods fields
  * Re-lable spreadsheets with mods field names from used labels
 * After downloading the MODS datastreams, Chris uses some scripts originally developed to transform a folder of MODS files to a CSV--and back again--by Cara Key at Louisiana State University. The can be found on her github at [https://github.com/carakey/xml2csv](https://github.com/carakey/xml2csv) as well as LSU's git repository.
  * XML2CSV uses a series of scripts. Chris uses 2 in his work.
  * The first script takes a folder of individual mods xml files and merges them into a single file with modscollection as the top element and each record as its own mods record, adding the filename/PID as an identifier
  * The second script is then run on the merged xml file and creates an xml file with all the Xpaths it features.
   * This means _all_ Xpaths, so if two files feature different versions of MODS in the namespace, they will feature separate Xpaths. If attributes are in a different order, then those will be two separate xpaths.
   * Chris uses BBEdit to clean-up the list. Finding and replacing the XML element wrappers to retain just the values. Then using BBEdit's Text > Process Duplicate Lines to clean-up duplicate lines. Then find/replace for the different namespaces. Finally using Text > Sort lines to better organize
   * Will include all elements and all attributes. Good way to find out what attribute values you are using for identifying things like authorities.
 * Another method to both identify used fields and export metadata as a CSV is using SOLR. Both Paige & Chris have used it, but neither have an active I7 site to be able to demonstrate. We will work on that for the future.

* Wishlist
 * Unfortunatly we ran out of time and the Wishlist discussion will be moved to our next meeting on November 6.

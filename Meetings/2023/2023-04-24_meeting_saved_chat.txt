12:14:37 From Dani Kroon to Everyone:
	How do you know what numbers to associate with Spring, summer etc?
12:15:26 From Rosie Le Faive (she/they) to Everyone:
	@Dani it's in the EDTF specification. We don't have a cheat sheet...
	but I think I added (or could add!) a link to the EDTF specification in the "description" of our date fields
12:15:50 From Dani Kroon to Everyone:
	that would super helpful
12:15:58 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:
	@Dani, here's a site I've used: https://www.loc.gov/standards/datetime/
12:16:41 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:
	Replying to "@Dani, here's a site..."
	
	see section "Level 1": Seasons		The values 21, 22, 23, 24 may be used used to signify ' Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn', 'Winter', respectively, in place of a month value (01 through 12) for a year-and-month format string.
12:17:08 From Dani Kroon to Everyone:
	Reacted to "see section "Level 1..." with üëç
12:17:21 From Rosie Le Faive (she/they) to Everyone:
	Replying to "@Dani, here's a site..."
	
	And to confuse things, under Level 2 you can signify 'summer in the northern hemisphere' vs 'summer in the southern hemisphere'
12:17:29 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:
	Reacted to "And to confuse thing..." with üëçüèΩ
12:17:37 From Dani Kroon to Everyone:

12:25:23 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:

12:32:27 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:

	Reacted to "Thank you so much" with üëçüèΩ
12:41:07 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:
	We've locally applied a "statement of responsibility" field to capture data as printed on the object (but it's only used for metadata from MARC for now)
12:42:49 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:
	Good call! I like adding to description, too
12:48:37 From Ross, Staci L to Everyone:
	Agreed, this is a bit too much specificity for our use cases, lol
12:53:52 From Seth Shaw to Everyone:
	Y171010000S3
12:54:07 From Seth Shaw to Everyone:
	some year between 171000000 and 171999999 estimated to be 171010000

### Notes: 
* Announcements
   * Red Rot: Mike shared a cassette tape he'd recently purchased by a hardcore punk band named Red Rot, consisting of four librarians writing punk music about library stuff. You can see them on their [Bandcamp](https://redrot.bandcamp.com/album/title-not-identified) Their album is titled [Title not identified] and features a lonely book cart on the cover.
   * Starter Site is still in Stay Tuned Mode.
   * [Survey](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-Metadata-Interest-Group/blob/main/Meetings/2023/2023-01-30.md#:~:text=you%20can%20visit-,this%20link,-to%20visit%20us) is still open if you want to submit
* Fields of the Week: Abstract, Description, Notes, Table of Contents
   * Abstract and Description often treated the same way if they are separate.
      Might seem strange to have both, Whitman has learned they need two different fields for display purposes
      In I7 you could change the label based on collection, and just have one field
   * Note field is repeatable, to reflect the different types of Note from MODS, even if no way to specify different note types
   * Table of Contents, again to separate out a different type of description
   * All can be text or shades of HTML
   * Can have a default value, say a note that says "Property Of X" in every record
   * Workbench supports line breaks as they exist in the spreadsheet
   * Watch out for the character limit, since this cannot be changed after content is added
* Fields of the Week Discussion
   * Mike: in Dublin Core there is description; in DCTERMS there is description, table of contents, and abstract. Abstract in DC is specific to a thesis abstract, stricter of a description
   * Mike: always 
   * Chris: Using Paragraphs with Note can allow different note types; can not restrict by user type based on note type
   * Chris: SAIC had separate Admin Notes field so as to restrict access to the value; separate Admin, Note, and Donor Note
   * Harriet: Asked about Paragraphs and we discussed how they work within a Content Type. Annie shared [this link](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs) for more information
   * Devon: We abandoned paragraphs because of not working with RDF and it made the metadata form too complex
   * Mike: Be wary of formatting options, since things like line breaks and bold can be handled differently by different systems/softwareUsing formatting can lead to practices that would strip value from the data.
   * Chris mentioned Formatted Lists for Table of Contents, where the text could benefit from the formatting but also lose context
   * Seth: Paragraphs and RDF, there has been some work but he hasn't reviewed it. Serializes the elements in a paragraph to a single value in the RDF. ASU has been doing this work.
   * Seth explained Blank Node a little more. Objects without an internal identifier. One theory was taking a paragraph node and turning it into a blank node. 
   * Seth talked about building more types of notes field without creating separate drupal fields, allow an ever expanding list of types
   * Also paragraphs do not play with Workbench at this time
* General Questions/Discussion
   * Annie: Asked about when Paige ran up against built in character limits in fields. Paige said they found it when doing tests, so they were able to empty out the database and make the adjustments in time for the actual migration. Only other way would be to add a new field that can handle the characters.
   * Mike: Shared an example of a subtitle the length of an abstract: "The Practical Distiller: or an introduction to making Whiskey, Gin, Brandy, Spirits, &c. &c. of better quality, and in larger quantities, than produced by the present mode of distilling, from the produce of the United States: such as Rye, Corn, Buckwheat, Apples, Peaches, Potatoes, Pumpions[sic] and Turnips. With directions how to conduct and improve the practical part of distilling in all its branches. Together with directions for purifying, clearing and colouring Whiskey, making Spirits similar to French Brandy, &c. from the Spirits of Rye, Corn, Apples, Potatoes &c. &c. and sundry extracts of approved receipts for making Cider, domestic Wines, and Beer" [https://worldcat.org/title/476565308](https://worldcat.org/title/476565308)
   * Annie: Worked a little with Migrate 7.x CLAW, doesn't include groups anymore? Drush dropped groups. UI no longer works with current Drush. Seth mentioned that the UI had previously had issues with size of migration, which made it difficult. Annie says she is hearing Workbench is the easier path, but the spreadsheet formatting is still overwhelming to her.  Issues with referencing the original files.
   * Paige: We used workbench. Used URL for publicly available files and gave vendor access to server for migrating restricted files.
   * Seth: Someone deleted a vocabulary term that had been in 900+ records but who is not recorded. So be careful of permissions.

* Open Conversation as time allows


### Notes: 

* Announcements
 * Rosie: Is working on Part 2 for Exporting Names demonstration; scheduled for next meeting
* MIG Wishlist
 * See the Wishlist at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nzg6a89LSBunlF0OJLpiRg0tAl1LLI7vP4aYmoJeWpo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nzg6a89LSBunlF0OJLpiRg0tAl1LLI7vP4aYmoJeWpo/edit?usp=sharing)
 * The following are notes on the conversation that led to the items in the Wishlist Document.
 * Typed String Field: Connect a field to a string field, so, for example, you can provide different Identifier types in a single field (Rosie)
  * Joe says there was something he developed at Kent State that did something similar; will look into notes
 * Prefilled Marc Country Code/Term vocabulary; Language Term/Code vocabulary
  * Code + Term in vocabulary; bring in code from MARC; display Term in Metadata Display
 * RDF Generation In Drupal: Now using Metatag module; work to improve the way our data is displayed in this way.
  * Don't really distinguish between the digital object and what the object represents
  * Normally metadata describes the original, with technical or admin to describe the digital object
 * Keydate/Sort Date: A field to be used for sorting that would be conditional, equal to Date Created if not then Date Issued if not then Copyright Date etc.
  * Rosie shared a experimental site she is playing with
  * Multiple objects with different types of dates (or no dates), some with multiple dates
  * SOLR Index Year field > Processor = EDTF Year in SOLR and pick which fields, but it doesn't let you pick or rank the dates used
  * Results are mixed for results with multiple dates
  * Reduces dates to just a year
* Open Discussion was skipped due to time.

### Next meeting:
 November 20, 2023

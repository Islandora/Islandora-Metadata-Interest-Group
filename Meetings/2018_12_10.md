### Agenda:
1. Announcements

* last meeting of 2018! Next meeting is January 14. 
* Welcome new attendees! 
  
1. Review mapping for mods:subject in all its forms
 
1. mods:abstract

* We'll do dcterms:abstract, just like Samvera does.

1. mods:notes

* We'll do skos:note, just like Samvera does. Also we'll concatenate the note type to the front of the note, preferring first the @displayLabel attribute if it exists, if not using the @type attribute if it exists. See Samvera docs for examples.

1. mods:identifiers

* We had some identifiers pulled out that we knew were used in Islandora instances, including OCLC number, ISBN, ISSN. We decided these (at least) should have their own predicates because those are very common and meaningfully distinct from each other. We had previously mapped all identifiers to a generic dc:identifier predicate, but think that a small handful should get special treatment. We propose that the mapping algorithm should not try to distinguish the type of the identifier. If an institution has been putting ISBNs in <mods:identifier> elements without @type attributes, it'll be up to the institution to add the attribute or migrate from CSV. 

### Notes:

### Next meeting:
January 14, 2019: 
   * Playing with an actual work in progress in CLAW.

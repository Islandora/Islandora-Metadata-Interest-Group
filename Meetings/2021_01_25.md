### Agenda:
* Announcements
* Review of possibilities identified in last meeting
* Open call for any other possibilities
* Pick one or two priorities from the possibilities
* Identify next steps toward the identified priorities
* Open round table

### Possibilities summary

* Sprint focusing on documenting migration process (with focus on the metadata work)
* Sprint focused on technical metadata. This would start with formalizing use cases/wireframes for the changes we want to see, and identifying the distinct issues that can be passed to devs
* Sprint reviewing our current documents that specify our metadata migration specifications, and verifying that things are working as expected
* Documentation decisions/outlining: Determine where the following should live (consult DIG?) and how they should be structured:
  * Metadata-oriented "translation"/gloss on the main documentation (i.e. adding examples/terminology that metadata folks would be more familiar with)
  * Page listing topics metadata folks should be aware of and should discuss with developers at their institution (and/or test in their instance). One example: check that any fields set to be treated as a string in Solr can be searched without entering the whole exact field value.
  * Place to gather informal community "things we learned" or "what I wish I knew at the beginning" info as more institutions begin moving into I8.  
* More on communication between metadata folks and devs
* Demos of new code
* Organize informal/semi-official MIG representatives to other groups

### Notes
* Announcements
    
### Next Meeting:
* February 8, 2021

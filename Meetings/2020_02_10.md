### Agenda:
* Announcements
* Discussion: Mark Jordan joins us to discuss some metadata management tools he has developed
  * https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_get_csv, lets a user generate a CSV of all the Solr fields used in an Islandora collection
  * https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_field_values, lets a user get a list of all unique values in a specified field. 
  * They both query Solr directly (via Islandora) and not MODS datastreams directly, and require some understanding of the arcane field names used in Islandora Solr indexes. That said, both of them are initial versions, and like everything else Islandora, more eyes on them will help improve them and make them more generally useful.

### Minutes:
* Announcement
  * How to bring feedback to the MIG on Migration Documents - Send it to a co-conveners and we'll add it to the agenda, likely for the next meeting.
* Mark Jordan's Migration Tools
  * Rosie showed off a diagram to set everyone on the same page - The basic path using the default migration path, or fork the basic path to handle your specialized data, or push your data out to CSV for cleaning and re-import.
  * Mark Jordan - Both tools are in their first version - looking for feedback to improve them - please go to the GitHub sites and add comments, thumbs, requests, etc.
  * Both tools have a GUI and Drush tool. Drush is good if you around running on large batch - can slow down/time-out in GUI if the batch is too big.
  * SFU is currently planning for migration from 7x to 8. Still making decisions on how they will migrate. Metadata needs a lot of work before migration can happen - needed tools to help them prepare.
    * Interested in a hybrid migration - use Migrate 7x to bring over objs with stub metadata - then use CSV import to bring the data together. The current tool brings in bad MODS - they want to fix the data in the middle.
  * Islandora Get CSV - https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_get_csv.
    * When installed - the tool is available from the Islandora 7 Collection/Collections Tab 
    * Export CSV - fields are represented as MODS via Islandora index in Solr; can set either "Is Member of" or "Ancestors"
    * Showed demonstration on small collection, then went live and ran it on a live collection with over 6000 objects.
    * Showed Admin options - Field Inclusion Options (Solr field pattern, Solr field types to include, Solr fiels to include) / Field Exclusion Options (Solr fields to exclude, Remove single-value fields where applicable).
    * How does the tool handle repeated fields? It should present them in a single field, comma seperated. 
  * Brief plug for Mark's Islandora Metadata Extra's tool https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_metadata_extras
  * Islandora Get Field Values https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_field_values
    * First enter a Solr field, e.g. mods_genre_s, submit - provides a list of all unique terms, count of objects with that term, and a link to run a query to view results. 
    * Ran on small local and live collection again.
    * Demonstrated results, but ran out of time before questions.

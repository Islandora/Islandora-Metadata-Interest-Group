* Continuing Migration from CSV demo
* Next Meeting Request to review: https://github.com/Islandora/controlled_access_terms/pull/35

### Minutes:
* Rosie continued the CSV migration demo - This was another "you kind of had to be there" session
  * Reminder - we have a CSV of metadata with almost 1400 objects
  * Last time we did a lot with modifying yaml.
  * This time, weâ€™re looking at creating a feature.
  * Last time had some problems:
    * Hyphens not allowed in machine names
    * Microsoft Excel sometimes does gross things, like adding byte order marks
      * Byte order marks; Removed in VIM 
      * Slashes in column names needed to be removed or escaped
      * Renamed the columns
  * Why example of CSV rather than XML? 
    * Possibility to use tools like OpenRefine to clean and reconcile data. Could do migration direct with XML too.
  * Successfully ingested a sample group of three objects.
  * Ingesting the full batch
  * Worked on mapping more of the fields as examples - Added title, partName, partNumber.

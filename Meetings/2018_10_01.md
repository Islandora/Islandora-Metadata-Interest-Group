1. Announcements

       1. CLAW MIG MODS-RDF Simplified Mapping (formerly CLAW MIG Sprint Prep Mapping)
       1. CLAW MIG MODS-RDF Simplified Mapping (formerly CLAW MIG Sprint Prep Mapping)
1. Review Dates, specifically [EDTF Widgit](https://github.com/Islandora-CLAW/islandora_demo/pull/2)
     1. Decisions made last week are represented in the code as it exists now. 
     1. Widget on top of a text field. It will only works to force a user at a form to require them to enter a properly formatted. 
     1. Dates (or other information) could be entered into this field via other methods.
     1. Commitment from developers to "make it work" from a sorting/faceting perspective.
1. Review other originInfo elements mapping:
     1. mods/originInfo/frequency
     1. mods/originInfo/issuance
     1. mods/originInfo/edition
          1. No really good, "obvious" mapping in DC or DC Terms for any of these. Maybe investigate Schema.org, Bibliographic Ontology, Core Ontology, LOC Linked Data Service-Publication Frequencies.
          1. [RDAU](http://www.rdaregistry.info/Elements/u/) may be a solution? Has good URIs for all 3 in question.
     1. mods/originInfo/dateCaptured
          1. PREMIS Captured vs. PREMIS Creation - Creation looks "more right".
1. Map originInfo publisher (agent) elements
     1. Treat just like other names, but gets agent of "publisher". 
     1. Rosie - Linking Data benefits vs Representing what is on the book. Dealing with publisher name changes over time.
     1. Approved by the MIG. Attempt to reconcile, but not required.
1. Open for additional questions/comments


### Next meetings:
1. October 15, 2018: Place of publication and Geographic subjects
1. October 29, 2018: Other Subjects, approve Notes/Description

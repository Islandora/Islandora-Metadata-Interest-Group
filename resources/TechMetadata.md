Technical Metadata
  -- I'm working for the definitions put forth in the Understanding Metadata, by Jenn Riley (NISO, 2017)
  -- There are a lot of definitions out there and the lines can blur between types.
  -- I'm considering Administrative Data to be a sort of umbrella
    -- Technical Metadata  - Decoding and rendering files
    -- Preservation Metadata - Long-term management of files
    -- Rights Metadata - Intellectual property rights attached to content.
  -- Technical Metadata
    -- Characteristics
      -- Often embedded in the file
      -- Tends to be information for the computer to "understand" the file(s)
      -- May be used by repo managers to evaluate digital objects (creation date, file formats, hardware/software)
      -- Important for interoperability, digital object management, and preservation
    -- Example properties
      -- File type
      -- File size
      -- Creation date/time
      -- Compression scheme
      -- Hardware and software used to acquire the digital object
      -- Resolution
      -- Color profiles
    -- Tools
      -- Tools like JHOVE, EXIF, DROID, etc can identify, extract, and/or validate Tech Metadata
      -- FITS (File Information Tool Set) is a tool that wraps a lot of these tools together.
      -- FITS can also transform the data from these tools into existing
    -- Common standards/Schema
      -- FITS XML (wrapper XML file that also contains core technical metadata fields)
        -- Identification (file format in one or more identity blocks)
        -- File Information (basic technical metadata that isn't specific to any format)
        -- File Status (validity information)
        -- Metadata (each tool's native output that has been normalized and consolidated by FITS)
        -- Tool Output (configurable - this section contains the output from each tool that ran against the file)
        -- Statistics (records how much time each wrapped tool spent processing the file)
      -- MIX (NISO Metadata for images in XML)
      -- TextMD
      -- AES Audio Object
      -- DocumentMD
      -- EBUCore
      -- ContainerMD
